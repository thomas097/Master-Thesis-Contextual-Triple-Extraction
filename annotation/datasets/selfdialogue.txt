They were 23 and 15. Now, it's 23 and 16. <eos> Oh, you mean they lost last night? <eos> Yes, it was close though.
Yes, it was close though. <eos> How close was that baseball game? <eos> The final was 6 to 5.
Me too. <eos> Do you remember you're first game? <eos> No.
I remember mine. <eos> Who was it with? <eos> Your boyfriend.
Your boyfriend. <eos> Really? <eos> Yeah, we had such a great time.
I'm game of your guys are. <eos> Is there a game tonight? <eos> Dude, it's summer time. There's a game every night.
Your right. <eos> We could go to a game of you boys want? <eos> Let's stay home.
i just started to and its pretty interesting. <eos> whats interesting about it? <eos> well the guys butts always look good.
you wont be disappointed, i promise. <eos> what time does it come on? <eos> i know during the season, its n almost every night.
tickets aren't that expensive. <eos> how much do they run? <eos> i think we paid like 10 bucks to get in.
I support the Cubs primarily. <eos> What city are there from? <eos> Chicago. I also like the Mets.
Yeah I get that. <eos> What about you, favorite team? <eos> I like the Dodgers.
Yeah it's just okay for me. <eos> Just okay? <eos> Yeah, hard to watch these days.
Yeah, hard to watch these days. <eos> Why's that? <eos> I don't like all the steroid stuff.
Yeah. <eos> What is it about that? <eos> The drug use has really turned me off of baseball.
Great! I'll check to see what tickets are still available. <eos> I wonder who the starting pitcher for the Reds is Sunday? <eos> I am not sure it matters; they are all bad.
Yeah! Its already started. <eos> What? You mean to tell me I missed baseball's opening day? <eos> Yep. Missed it by over a month.
Yup, they did. <eos> Nice. Who did they play? <eos> The Dodgers.
The Dodgers. <eos> Nice. Did they win? <eos> Yup, they did.
Yup, they did. <eos> Do you mind telling me the score? <eos> Five to Two. Was closer than the score showed though.
Five to Two. Was closer than the score showed though. <eos> So it was a good game? <eos> Yea, went right down to the final at bats.
Yea, went right down to the final at bats. <eos> Nice. Are they playing again today? <eos> They are, at noon I think.
They lost, four to ten. <eos> Who did they play again? <eos> They were playing the Pirates.
The Pirates won 10-4. It was a great game. <eos> Did Bryce Harper have any hits? <eos> Yes, I believe he got 2 hits.
He is going to ask for over 400 million dollars. <eos> Do you think they will pay him? <eos> It depends on whether they have the money.
Pretty well! Leading their division. <eos> Think they'll make the postseason? <eos> Pretty confident.
That was crazy! I did not see that coming. <eos> Me either, what was the score again? <eos> It was five to nine. I was really happy about it.
Yeah. But it's a late start west coast game. <eos> I hate those games. Oakland tonight right? <eos> Yeah. I'm not sure how they're doing this year.
Yeah I like it. <eos> Do you have a favorite team? <eos> Yeah I'm a Sox fan.
Yeah I'm a Sox fan. <eos> White or Red? <eos> The Red Sox.
The Red Sox. <eos> Oh okay.  You from Boston? <eos> Yeah born and bred.
Oh okay neat. <eos> Do you have a team? <eos> Yeah I like the Rangers.
The Cleveland Spiders. They were a pretty good team, too. <eos> How did you know that? <eos> Lucky guess. Next question.
That's a piece of baseball knowledge. <eos> So why 88? <eos> I really don't know why, but it's 88.
Yes they do. <eos> Why? <eos> It's so that the ball dosent slip out of their hand.
It goes against what teams should do. <eos> I mean are the inmates running things over there? <eos> The team needs to evaluate its training staff.
Probably after the all star break sometime. <eos> Are you a Giants fan too? <eos> Yes, but I am realistic about them.
I bet they can comeback after the all star break. <eos> Do you think the Dodgers are good? <eos> They have only one pitcher and Justin Turner just got hurt.
There's not really an mlb team near me. <eos> Minors? <eos> I think there is a farm team near us.
I think there is a farm team near us. <eos> Have you ever gone to a game? <eos> Never been to a game before.
Man the Houston Astros are on fire. <eos> Did they win again? <eos> Yep..they won last night.
They have won 9 of their last twelve games. <eos> How are they doing it? <eos> They are getting timely hitting.
I can't believe how well they are playing right now. <eos> Can they keep it going? <eos> Well that is the magic question.
Well, there were a ton of home runs, all mammoth. <eos> You think home runs are the best play in baseball? <eos> Of course! No one wants to watch a 1-0 strikeout fest.
I would say 97 or 98. <eos> You don't think the Rangers can catch them? <eos> The Rangers are ok, but they have their own problems.
I think that question is hard to answer. <eos> How so? <eos> There are a bunch of mitigating factors.
Yeah there wasn't a big talent pool to choose from. <eos> Do you watch a lot of baseball? <eos> Yeah some, I'll catch a few games now and then.
Well, it ended up costed them the game. <eos> Oh, what happened? <eos> Well, first he threw a ball and beaned the batter.
Well, first he threw a ball and beaned the batter. <eos> Oh, that sucks.  Why didn't they take him out then? <eos> I don't know, but then he walked the next batter.
Ha ha, your funny. <eos> Do you remember that baseball bit? <eos> Kinda. Who started it.
Dodgers and Marlins. <eos> Who won? <eos> The Dodgers.
The Dodgers. <eos> What was the score? <eos> 5 to 3.It was a good game.
Why else? The dodges seer back in town. <eos> Do they play then tonight? <eos> Yup, at 710 for the first pitch.
Nope. They just laughed and pointed and spit tobaccy jiuce. <eos> I suppose it's pointless to ask if they won? <eos> Yes, yes it is.
That's good. <eos> Are you a baseball fan? <eos> Yep, I really like baseball.
Yep, I really like baseball. <eos> Did you ever play? <eos> I played a little bit.
I played a little bit. <eos> Oh interesting, when did you play? <eos> I played a bit in high school.
Cool. <eos> Did you ever play? <eos> I only played little league.
You missed it. <eos> Missed what? <eos> He just stole home.
He just stole home. <eos> What? <eos> Keno just stole home.
My cable went out. It's back. <eos> Did you see him avoid getting hit? <eos> No.
Yeah I like baseball all right. <eos> Do you have a team you like? <eos> Yeah I like the Braves.
That's cool I like the Braves too. <eos> Oh neat, who is your favorite player? <eos> I like Freddie Freeman.
That's a great team as well. <eos> Do you ever get the chance to play? <eos> Sometimes, I get together with a few friends and we play.
It's so boring. <eos> Have you ever seen a game live? <eos> No.
Yeah I like baseball sure. <eos> Do you have a team? <eos> Hmm let me think.
Ugh. <eos> Seattle? <eos> Ugh, no.
Maybe. <eos> Washington? <eos> Actually, huh.
The team did go away for years. <eos> What happened? <eos> I just think the franchise just ended due to money.
I just think the franchise just ended due to money. <eos> It's been, what 5 years since the team started up again? <eos> That sounds about right.
That sounds about right. <eos> Have they ever one a world series? <eos> I don't think so.
I don't think so. <eos> Do you think they have a chance this year? <eos> I don't really know. I don't follow them.
Yes, it was terrific. <eos> Wow, what happened? <eos> The pitcher threw a no-hitter.
He sure is. <eos> Was he a veteran? <eos> No, what is amazing is that he is a rookie.
Yea, the crowd was going wild. <eos> Even the greatest Cubs players couldn't get a hit? <eos> Yep, their top hitter was struck out.
The Cubs play the Cardinals Friday, Saturday and Sunday. <eos> Are you going to attend? <eos> I wish I were.
I don't know. <eos> How about Mo Vaughn? <eos> He's like a teddy bear.
I'll give you a clue. <eos> What is that clue? <eos> They just changed a street name to his name.
He was giving away baseballs. <eos> Did you get one? <eos> I got 2. Nobody was there.
It's true. It was not advertised. <eos> How many people were there? <eos> 3 in total.
Yeah I like baseball. <eos> What do you like most about baseball? <eos> That's an interesting question.  Let me think.
They do this every year. <eos> Have strong regular seasons? <eos> Yeah and then they fumble it come October.
Boston Americans vs Pittsburg Pirates. <eos> let me guess. Boston Americans became the Red Sox? <eos> Yep.
I know, I thought they would be doing better. <eos> What is their record? <eos> They are at 21 and 19 right now.
Did you ever. <eos> What happened? <eos> They cleared the benches in Los Angeles.
They cleared the benches in Los Angeles. <eos> What? Why? <eos> Ross Stripling hit Stanton with a throw.
Yeah, but the hitters aren't hitting either. <eos> I guess. Stanton is batting what, .250? <eos> I hate to say it, but he's extremely overrated. That contract...
It sure was. <eos> Aren't you glad you we? <eos> Yes, thanks for the tickets.
No problem. <eos> So now we are in first place? <eos> We are tied with the giants.
We are tied with the giants. <eos> How long have they been our rivals? <eos> Ever since both were in New York.
It was pretty cool. <eos> What did you do with the ball? <eos> I gave it to my boyfriend.
I gave it to my boyfriend. <eos> Does he know you went with me? <eos> No, if he found out he would be upset.
He could go on another 12 years doing what he's doing. <eos> So you'd take Kershaw over Bryce Harper? <eos> Definitely. Harper is inconsistent and susceptible to injuries.
Bruce is a good player, and they don't really need Granderson. <eos> But why do they keep pretending Wright will contribute? <eos> I don't think they do.
I think he's earned the right to decide when he's done. <eos> Not if it hurts the team? <eos> It's not. They have Reyes.
Yes, Young scored after Ramirez hit a triple into center field. <eos> Was it out of the reach of Lindor? <eos> Yes, it was almost a home run.
No. <eos> Did you record it? <eos> yes.
They're my favorite team afterall. <eos> WIll you watch it tonight? <eos> Oh yes.
Just a few my self. <eos> Which was your favorite? <eos> I have none. I just love baseball.
That would be cool. <eos> How about you? <eos> Cubs Stadium.
Really? If you do, let me know. <eos> You want to go to the ball park too? <eos> Of course! I have to support my team.
Love baseball. <eos> Oh yeah?  Big fan? <eos> Yeah.
Yeah. <eos> That's cool, did you ever play? <eos> Yeah I played for a bit, but wasn't that good.
Yeah I played in high school. <eos> What position? <eos> I was pitching.
The Rangers! I remember their team from the early '90s, even. <eos> Yeah? Rafael Palmeiro? <eos> Sure. I don't recall them all.
The one guy from Bolivia(I think) qualifies. <eos> Sure. How many baseball players have huge pirate-style beards? <eos> He's the only one coming to mind right now.
That again infringes on their rights. <eos> During the season? <eos> At any point.
Yeah, those were the days... <eos> Anyway, see you tomorrow at the game? <eos> 7pm against the Rockies -- see you there.
My son has a ball game tonight. <eos> Oh, he's still playing? <eos> Yeah, this is his fourth year.
I wouldn't be surprised if Toronto took it to them tonight. <eos> Me either.  What time is the game? <eos> I think first pitch is at 7:05pm.
Good, everyone is playing about where I thought they would. <eos> Are you surprised about the Cubs being so bad? <eos> I dont think they are bad, just going through the pains.
How are you. <eos> Doing good, you? <eos> Same.
Same. <eos> Do you like baseball? <eos> Yeah I like baseball.
Yeah, but I stream some games. <eos> Oh, like online? <eos> Yeah I have an MLB package deal.
Their midgame is still decades old. <eos> Yeah, and? <eos> It's boring.
I saw the Mets last year. <eos> Cool where? <eos> In L.A..
In L.A.. <eos> Who did they play? <eos> They played the angles.
They played the angles. <eos> Did the angles win? <eos> Yes.
Yes. <eos> Was it a good game? <eos> It was ok I guess.
It was ok I guess. <eos> Would you want to see them play again? <eos> No, it was a sad game.
Same. <eos> Do you watch baseball? <eos> Yeah I like baseball.
Same here. <eos> Do you have a favorite team? <eos> I do.  But they're a local team.
Yeah I bet that is a good time. <eos> What is the name of the team? <eos> They're the smokies.
Not really.  I need to buy a new bat. <eos> What's wrong with your old one? <eos> I broke it at practice yesterday.
I broke it at practice yesterday. <eos> Was it when you hit that home run? <eos> Yeah, it cracked down the side.
You can use my bat for practice today. <eos> Alright.  What brand is it? <eos> It's a Louisville Slugger.
Same here.  There's nothing like a Louisville. <eos> What type of glove do you use? <eos> I have a Wilson.
Yeah they are not a good team. <eos> Why do you say that? <eos> Their pitching is terrible.
Their pitching is terrible. <eos> Is it relief or starting? <eos> A little bit of both.
A little bit of both. <eos> Whats worse? <eos> I would say the relief pitching. Numbers wise.
They yank them in the 5th almost every game. <eos> OK so that expends the relievers? <eos> Yes and they arent that good to begin with.
Yes and they arent that good to begin with. <eos> So what do you think they need to do? <eos> I would go build out the starting pitching first.
What's going on. <eos> Not much, you? <eos> Same here.
Cool. <eos> You like baseball? <eos> Yeah I like baseball alright.
Yeah I like baseball alright. <eos> Yeah same here.  Do you have a team? <eos> Yeah I like the Tigers.
Oh okay, cool. <eos> What about you? <eos> I like the Braves.
Oh okay. <eos> What about you? <eos> I like Julio Teheran.
Yes, that one. <eos> I sure did, wasn't it a great night? <eos> Absolutely, he was such a great player.
Absolutely, he was such a great player. <eos> Agreed, how about the crowd? <eos> They were on fire.
Certainly, you can't overlook the veteran players added to the team. <eos> Do you think they will go all the way? <eos> It's impossible to predict, I'd just enjoy it while it lasts.
No at the baseball Game tonight. <eos> What? <eos> I won a contest and were going to sing.
Definitely not. I hit the ball once or twice. <eos> Do you have any favorite baseball players? <eos> Yes, I like Cal Ripken. He played for the Baltimore Orioles.
No, but I have heard it is a nice stadium. <eos> What do you like most about baseball? <eos> The food. I love the hot dogs.
America's been doing surprisingly well. <eos> Really? <eos> Boston's been killing it hard.
Boston's been killing it hard. <eos> Wow, Boston? <eos> Yeah, I know.
Yeah, I know. <eos> Even New Brunswick? <eos> That's a little much.
I get tickets occasional as perks. <eos> To which games? <eos> The Rangers.
Yeah I played a little bit. <eos> Oh interesting.  What level did you play at college? <eos> No never made it that far.
No never made it that far. <eos> No? <eos> Only went up to high school.
Only went up to high school. <eos> Were you any good? <eos> I was okay.
I was okay. <eos> What position did you play? <eos> I was catcher.
Same. <eos> You into baseball? <eos> Yeah I like it okay.
Same here. <eos> Who do you think is the best player in baseball now? <eos> That is a good question.  Hmm.
They are but it's not ready yet. <eos> Oh wow.  So who won the game? <eos> The bears did.
but that new coach they got apparently is no good. <eos> really?  That Daniels guy? <eos> Yes, the new one from Florida.
They killed all game. <eos> Like, stealing? <eos> It was extremely disrespectful.
It was extremely disrespectful. <eos> How many? <eos> 20.
20. <eos> What? <eos> Seriously.
No. You have it wrong. <eos> How? <eos> That's how players would get paid off.
That's how players would get paid off. <eos> Paid off? <eos> Yeah baseball games could be bought out to win or lose.
I think maybe its his age. <eos> How old is he? <eos> Old man Lasorda is 89 years old.
Pretty much.  Mud made the defense hard. <eos> I could understand that.  How'd your brother do? <eos> He went 2 for 3 and had a walk.
Yeah the Rockies ran all over them last night. <eos> What was the final score again? <eos> The Rockies crushed them 12-6.
Guess what I did at the game. <eos> What? <eos> I hit a home run. It was so awesome.
That's because I thought it would be boring. <eos> It's not, though, is it? <eos> No way. I hit a homer. It's a great game.
Even if it doesn't happen I'll still enjoy the game. <eos> What if I do really badly? <eos> I will still enjoy watching you play. I like baseball.
I will still enjoy watching you play. I like baseball. <eos> Is that why you wanted me to be in it? <eos> Kind of.
I guess I go for the A's from time to time. <eos> Oh? <eos> Yeah I'm not really attached.
I understand. <eos> What about you? <eos> I'm a Rays fan.
I don't knew, that's why I'm asking you. <eos> What? <eos> Just kidding. The had five.
Just kidding. The had five. <eos> Can I guess which ones? <eos> You'll never guess, but try.
Another good one. <eos> What about best CF for modern times? <eos> That's a little easier probably.
Was it? I might be glad I missed it then. <eos> Are you going to watch the game tonight? <eos> I want to but I think it's postponed.
I like him, but I miss Ross. <eos> Who do you think will pitch tonight? <eos> Probably Anderson if I had to guess.
Probably Anderson if I had to guess. <eos> Do you think they'll repeat their season? <eos> Well, it's kind of early to tell but they look good.
Definitely. <eos> Do you think Landon will? <eos> I hope so. It's his dream.
Oh, no not at all. <eos> What makes you say that? <eos> I think that there is too much money involved now.
Players have to focus on their main sport. <eos> Do you think baseball has written it into their contracts? <eos> Theres always that too.
The braves definitely got the better of that trade. <eos> Do you follow any teams in the American League? <eos> I follow Cleveland because my dad is a fan of them.
I know but he is a very critical sports fan. <eos> Do you follow college baseball at all? <eos> I do. I follow my alma mater, Florida State.
I agree with that but he's still putting up monster numbers. <eos> Who do you think can come out of the National League? <eos> I like the Nats or Dodgers to come out this year.
I thought they were okay, but not great. <eos> I agree.  What moves did you like? <eos> I liked how we got Chris Sale to help the rotation.
There were 5 near fights during the entire series. <eos> Wow. Between those teams? <eos> I know. They're not even rivals.
Yeah I love baseball. <eos> Who do you like? <eos> I'm a White Sox fan.
Yes, pretty much. He cut them to pieces. <eos> And how did that go over with the team? <eos> He was suspended for 5 games.
I did once. <eos> Was it awesome? <eos> People were screaming all over the place. It was pretty amazing.
People were screaming all over the place. It was pretty amazing. <eos> I can imagine. When was it? <eos> When I was in high school.
Yeah, actually you're right but it's from Philly. <eos> Big deal. Why don't you get one from Washington? <eos> I can only afford one jersey at a time.
Let's get back to the game. <eos> Okay, what was the score? <eos> I forgot. I'll check my ESPN app right now.
Yeah and if pitchers dealt with that it means more flyouts. <eos> So no one will break this record? <eos> No, not in my mind. Just like DiMaggio's record.
You Red Sox fans are all the same. <eos> What do you mean? <eos> Everyone thinks Nomar is the best thing since sliced bread.
Possible changes to the ruleset. <eos> Proposed, right? <eos> Not officially.
Absolutely. <eos> What's the details of it? <eos> Changing the rules for pop flies and homeruns.
Doing okay. <eos> Do you watch a lot of baseball? <eos> I don't get to as much as I like.
I don't get to as much as I like. <eos> Do you have a particular team that you go for? <eos> I like a local team near me.
I like a local team near me. <eos> Oh, like a minor league team? <eos> Yeah.
Yeah they are great. <eos> Are tickets expensive? <eos> No not at all, we go all the time.
Yeah a little bit. <eos> Cool.  Who is your favorite player? <eos> Mike Trout is a great player.
Yeah that he is. <eos> What about you? <eos> I like Julio Teheran.
I like Julio Teheran. <eos> Oh from the Braves right? <eos> Yeah that's right.
Yeah that's right. <eos> You a Braves fan? <eos> Yeah they are the closest to me.
That's cool. <eos> Is there a team near you? <eos> Not really.
I would not be surprised. <eos> Why? <eos> He looked tied.
They actually had it the next day, on Sunday. <eos> But didn't they already have a game scheduled on Sunday? <eos> Yep, they ended up having a double header.
Yep, they ended up having a double header. <eos> Wow, a double header on Mother's Day? <eos> Not only that, it was Derek Jeter day.
Not only that, it was Derek Jeter day. <eos> Isn't he already retired? <eos> Yeah, exactly.  They had a ceremony to retire his number.
Overrated. I don't see them going anywhere this year. <eos> Are you kidding me? With the bats they have? <eos> They are only at .500! Can't be that great...
The bullpen blew another save. <eos> Another one?  How many is that this year? <eos> Too many.
Internally, not really.  Everybody has been roughed up. <eos> What about trades? <eos> I think they would be very interested in that.
I think they would be very interested in that. <eos> How much do you think they would have to give up? <eos> I think it would depend upon who they are talking to.
I think it would depend upon who they are talking to. <eos> Who is available? <eos> I think the Royals closer, maybe the Rays or White Sox.
Ok. Fine,bring it. <eos> Who had the most homeruns over his career? <eos> Easy. Barry Bonds. 762. He passed Hank Aaron's record in 2007.
Morning. <eos> Do you like baseball? <eos> Yep, big fan.
Nice. <eos> What's your favorite thing about the game? <eos> That's a good question.
I played a bit myself. <eos> Were you good? <eos> Nope, terrible.
Same here. <eos> Ever been to a game? <eos> I have when I was a kid.
I have when I was a kid. <eos> Haven't been sense you were an adult? <eos> No, but I always talk about going.
They're tied for first with the Cubs. <eos> How does that sit with you? <eos> I don't get in to baseball rivalries.
I don't get in to baseball rivalries. <eos> Do you think the Cardinals will make the playoffs? <eos> The do almost every year.
The do almost every year. <eos> What about this year? <eos> They have good hitting.
They have good hitting. <eos> Do you think their defense is any good? <eos> They seems to be giving up a lot of runs.
They seems to be giving up a lot of runs. <eos> What do you think they can do? <eos> They need to get some new blood on the pitcher's mound.
Yeah I really like baseball. <eos> Ever been to a game? <eos> Yeah loads of them.
Yeah loads of them. <eos> Is it a lot of fun? <eos> Yeah I have a great time.
That sounds nice. <eos> You ever been? <eos> No, but I want to.
Cool. <eos> You from Atlanta? <eos> I grew up there but moved away.
Oh I see. <eos> You live there? <eos> Yeah in Atlanta.
Oh wow thats a surprise. <eos> Who does it on May 11th? <eos> I guess a team who is struggling with their identity.
Agree. Wang doesn't look good either. <eos> Wang? <eos> LOL Tanaka I mean. Not Wang.
Same. <eos> You a baseball fan? <eos> I do like baseball.
Yeah he is great. <eos> Anyone else? <eos> Hmm let me think.
No, but came close a couple of times. <eos> Did you see any homeruns? <eos> A few.
Its amazing considering how they used to be. <eos> I know, when did they ever have a farm system? <eos> Well it used to be all other MLB teams.
Wow, he's so good. <eos> Do you think they are gonna make the playoffs this year? <eos> I hope, it just depends on if they play consistently.
Not bad. <eos> Baseball fan? <eos> Yeah I like baseball.
Yeah I like baseball. <eos> Same here.  Who is your team? <eos> I like the Braves.
Hi there. <eos> Hi, what's your favorite sport? <eos> I would have to say baseball.
Yeah I do. <eos> Do you like a team? <eos> I like the Rays.
Oh okay Miami cool. <eos> Yeah my team.  what about you? <eos> I'm a Twins fan.
I'm a Twins fan. <eos> How do you think you will do this year? <eos> Started off pretty decent, maybe a good year.
Started off pretty decent, maybe a good year. <eos> Think you'll get to the playoffs? <eos> Don't know, I sure hope so.
The Rays are not doing well right now. <eos> Why is that? <eos> Not sure, the players can't get going.
Well thats where I think they are having issues. <eos> What do you mean? <eos> They arent developing guys like they used to.
Yeah I enjoy baseball. <eos> Ever seen a game live? <eos> Yeah I've been to a few Braves games.
Yeah I always liked it. <eos> Aren't they moving to a new stadium? <eos> Yeah pretty soon.
Same here. <eos> Do you have a team? <eos> I like the Mets.
Cool, me too. <eos> Do you like a team in particular? <eos> Yeah I'm a big Tigers fan.
Yeah I'm a big Tigers fan. <eos> Cool, how are they doing? <eos> Not to bad right now.
Not to bad right now. <eos> You think they'll make a playoff run? <eos> I don't know right now, I hope so though.
gotcha. <eos> What about you? <eos> I like the Indians.
They have good young players at several positions. <eos> Like who? <eos> Corey Seager is a really good shortstop in his second year.
Corey Seager is a really good shortstop in his second year. <eos> Who else? <eos> Cody Bellinger is a power hitter that just came up.
He can play first base and left or right field. <eos> Any young pitchers? <eos> Yeah, Julio Urias is only 20 and he's really good.
Wouldn't think of missing it.  I never miss that matchup. <eos> Did you watch the end of the Royals double-header? <eos> Yeah, the GM got doused with a cooler of Gatorade.
Pollack being back after a year off strengthens the line-up. <eos> How about the pitching? <eos> The starters have looked pretty strong.
The starters have looked pretty strong. <eos> Which ones have you liked? <eos> Grienke, Ray and Corbin have been strong.
Grienke, Ray and Corbin have been strong. <eos> How about the bullpen? <eos> Archie Bradley is vastly improved.
So far I have liked his style. <eos> What in particular? <eos> I like it that he doesn't yank pitchers too quickly.
I like baseball, but it's not my favorite sport. <eos> Do you have a favorite team? <eos> I like the Nationals.
I like the Nationals. <eos> Oh okay, you from there? <eos> No, but I moved here for work.
Yeah great city. <eos> How are they doing this year? <eos> Not bad, starting off okay.
That's good. <eos> What about you? <eos> I like the Mariners.
It is but not winning the division. <eos> The Braves did it how many years in a row? <eos> I think 13.
The Cardinals can never be counted out. <eos> What about the Pirates? <eos> I think their window closed.
They had the momentum for awhile. <eos> But back to the Cubs. Are they a dynasty? <eos> Theo Epstein only creates winners.
How are you. <eos> Good you? <eos> Great.
Oh I see. <eos> What about you? <eos> Yeah played a bit in high school.
Yeah played a bit in high school. <eos> Were you good? <eos> I was okay.
I was okay. <eos> What position? <eos> I played first base.
A little of both, plus some radio as well. <eos> Where is their stadium? <eos> It's in downtown Denver.
Yeah I like it. <eos> Like a team in particular? <eos> Yeah I like the Angels.
Oh cool, I'm a fan of the Yankees. <eos> Cool, ever been to a game? <eos> Yeah loads.
I agree, it should be fun. <eos> Are you going to watch it? <eos> You bet, I've  already got my chips and beer ready.
Nice. <eos> What team? <eos> I'm a Reds fan.
Oh okay.  I like the Mariners. <eos> Seattle? <eos> Yeah that's right.
Cool. <eos> You from Ohio? <eos> Grew up there when I was a kid and moved away.
Oh I see. <eos> You in Seattle? <eos> Yeah grew up here and stayed here.
I think so. <eos> We swept them right? <eos> Yeah, then got the same treatment from the Royals.
Fair enough. <eos> Did they reschedule the rainout? <eos> I dunno, haven't checked.
Not bad. <eos> Good, you like baseball? <eos> I do enjoy baseball.
Yeah I hear that. <eos> Are Dodgers games a lot? <eos> Oh yeah, sometimes over $100 a ticket.
Oh yeah, sometimes over $100 a ticket. <eos> Wow, even for the nosebleeds? <eos> Depends on the game, but yeah.
I do. <eos> Who is your team? <eos> I am a fan of the dodgers.
Nice. <eos> Have you ever seen a game live? <eos> I have a few times.
I hear you. <eos> Favorite player? <eos> Don't really have one.
How are you. <eos> Good you? <eos> Good.  You like baseball.
I do a bit. <eos> Not a big fan? <eos> My husband is a big Rockies fan.
I like Freedie Freeman. <eos> The first baseman? <eos> Yeah that's him.
Cool. <eos> You have a favorite player? <eos> No not really.
That sounds light. It'd have to be more than Baez. <eos> What about Baez plus Happ? <eos> That's a start. Still seems like a silly rumor.
I think Ervin Santana has a chance too. <eos> Who is the best pitcher in the National League right now? <eos> I think Clayton Kershaw is.
Hey. <eos> Like baseball? <eos> Yeah I'm a fan I guess.
Yeah I'm a fan I guess. <eos> Any team you support? <eos> I like the Padres.
oh okay. <eos> How about you? <eos> I like the Twins.
I like the Twins. <eos> You think they have a shot this year? <eos> I'm not sure.  They are starting out pretty mediocre.
I remember that, it was awful. He clearly reached over. <eos> Yours? <eos> I'm a Phillies fan. Joe Carter's World Series walk-off was devastating.
I do like baseball. <eos> You ever play? <eos> I only played when I was a kid.
Yeah same here. <eos> Do you have a team you like? <eos> I like the Orioles.
Man, Mookie Betts is having a good year though. <eos> Mookie Betts huh? <eos> Yeah, he's my first pick.
Yeah, he's my first pick. <eos> He's on Boston? <eos> Yeah Boston.
Well, they've been pushing Pedro a lot. <eos> Yeah, I know he got like what, 10 runs last time? <eos> No, 12.
I do like baseball. <eos> Have a favorite team? <eos> Yeah I like the Rockies.
Not bad. <eos> Good.  You into baseball? <eos> I like baseball, sure.
Yeah same here. <eos> Ever been to a ball park? <eos> I have once, when I was a kid.
I have once, when I was a kid. <eos> Oh cool, which one? <eos> Went to Camden Yards.
I have been a few times. <eos> Where? <eos> Turner field.
Turner field. <eos> That the braves? <eos> Yep.
Oh, that's good I have given up on them this year. <eos> Why is that? <eos> Well, all there young talent offensively is not mature enough yet.
To make matters worse, there pitching is awful. <eos> What part The starters or relievers? <eos> Well, both. But especially there bullpen.
I'm from Boston, so I love the Red Sox. <eos> Me too! Did you watch last night's game? <eos> Sure did. I'm glad they finally beat the Yankees.
Usually around April 1st, give or take a few days. <eos> How long does baseball season last? <eos> Around 6 months or so, with a month of playoff afterward.
The Senators play again tonight. <eos> Do you know when the Rangers play again? <eos> I think they play on the road tomorrow.
I'm pretty sure they won't blame this year on Girardi. <eos> Yeah, how can all those injuries be his fault? <eos> Exactly, plus they're young.
No, but we have tickets for later in the season. <eos> Which game are you going to? <eos> We are going in August to see the Braves vs Reds.
Yeah that seems better, some of these uniforms look terrible. <eos> How come they never do anything for Father's Day? <eos> No idea, very strange.
He had a homer in the 5th. <eos> Nice, anyone on base? <eos> Yeah, pederson.
Yup, they are fighting for first place. <eos> With who, the giants? <eos> No, the Rockies.
No, the Rockies. <eos> Didn't they just play a series with them? <eos> Yeah, the Dodgers took 2 of 3.
That's sick. <eos> Why? <eos> You're enjoying people's personal affairs being ruined.
The Yankees already have the best bullpen in baseball. <eos> Who do you think wins the AL Central? <eos> I bet the Indians.
Not at all. <eos> How come? <eos> I like sports with Asians and there aren't enough in baseball.
I like sports with Asians and there aren't enough in baseball. <eos> What about Ichiro? <eos> Yeah he was pretty awesome.
Two of the Rockies best runners. <eos> What happened? <eos> The first runner scores, the score is now 3-2.
Yes, I always try to catch those big rivalry games. <eos> The Giants won, right? <eos> Yes.  I think they've won four straight games now.
Yeah probably by about 20 games. <eos> Why that many? <eos> I think you need to end baseball by mid October.
I think they should expand benches. <eos> Just hitters? <eos> Yeah, teams should be able to carry 3 catchers.
It's the Dodgers and giants. <eos> Fyi you want to go to the game? <eos> I can't.
I can't. <eos> Why not? <eos> I hurt my for last night running.
No,I thought we could drive up and buy them there. <eos> Let's go, do you know who is pitching? <eos> No, but the game should be really good.
I feel the same. <eos> Are you buying food there? <eos> Yes, better bring a lot of money.
Believe it or not, it's the Houston Astros. <eos> Really? Weren't they the worst team just a few years ago? <eos> Yeah. But that's when they were in the National League.
Well we can see a minor league game. <eos> Where do those team play? <eos> There's a minor league team over in Somerset.
It's too bad that you missed it. <eos> Why's that? <eos> It was a 9-0 shut-out.
Wow. The Dodgers are doing great this year. <eos> They sure are. What game were you watching? <eos> I was watching the Red Sox and Yankees.
They are. That's why I usually try to catch their games. <eos> So, who won? <eos> The Yankess beat the Sox 2-1 in extra innings.
It was pretty cool. <eos> How so? <eos> They won in the bottom of the 9th.
They won in the bottom of the 9th. <eos> Really? <eos> Yes, it was amazing.
Wow! That's cool. <eos> Who was pitching? <eos> Smith was pitching.
Smith was pitching. <eos> Is he undefeated? <eos> No, but his ERA is 1.4.
Wow! That is super. <eos> Will you be going to any games this year? <eos> Yes, in June I'm going to see them play the Mets.
Hey, last night I went to the Mariners game. <eos> Really? Nice. Who were they playing? <eos> They were playing against their main rival.
Its fun to watch guys get close. <eos> Is there a stat youd like to see eliminated? <eos> I think RBI.
No. I watch it from the TV. <eos> Why do you like to watch it on the TV? <eos> Because it's a better view. I like the commercials.
Because it's a better view. I like the commercials. <eos> Are you being sarcastic? <eos> No, I like the shampoo commercials.
Or the world series. <eos> Wow, is it the world series right now? <eos> No. It's not the world series.
No. It's not the world series. <eos> Then why are you watching the baseball commercials? <eos> Because I'm an aspiring commercial actor.
Because I'm an aspiring commercial actor. <eos> I'm beginning think you don't like baseball. Is that true? <eos> No, I like baseball because of the shampoo commercials.
No, I like baseball because of the shampoo commercials. <eos> Dove or Pantene? <eos> Um. Avita is my choice actually.
Um. Avita is my choice actually. <eos> Red Sox or Astros? <eos> Pantene.
I have never seen that before. <eos> Plus 3 grand slams? <eos> I think, this was the highest scoring game ever.
Sure it's ok. <eos> Do you follow any teams? <eos> Not really during the season, it's too long.
Not really during the season, it's too long. <eos> Yeah true, ever been to a game? <eos> Once or twice.
Once or twice. <eos> What team did you go see? <eos> The Texas Rangers.
I was stunned, and my dad was pretty upset. <eos> Is he a Rangers fan? <eos> Yeah he's been a fan for a while.
The tickets are significantly cheaper. <eos> But then does that mean the players are paid less? <eos> The players are paid much less than in the Majors.
Perhaps I should try out and get a contract myself. <eos> Do you think you are good enough to play professionally? <eos> I'm not sure. I might not be fit enough for it.
And he decided to call a time out. <eos> You can do that in baseball? <eos> Apparently.
No, but he is still playing for the Marlins. <eos> Didn't he play for the Seattle Mariners for a long time? <eos> Yes, he did for about about 12 years.
I think they'll take the conference. <eos> You think they'll win? <eos> But I don't want them too.
Yeah... I forgot about the cavaliers. <eos> How can you forget Lebron James? <eos> I feel like Kawhi is the new LBJ.
Sure, and I'm fine with that. <eos> How could you say that? <eos> Well, the game is still being played by humans.
yes, it was another low scoring game. <eos> Did they win? <eos> Yes, they won 3-2.
Maybe he is finally seeing the ball better. <eos> Who will be pitching when we go to the game tomorrow? <eos> Unfortunately, Chris Young.
So, it's not a home run, then. <eos> What? <eos> It's a series of errors, not a home run.
Yes, I'm definitely going to catch that. <eos> Do you think he's the greatest Yankee of all time? <eos> No, my vote goes for Mr. October -- Reggie Jackson.
Yes. It was the Cleveland Indians. <eos> Didn't the Indians play in the World Series in recent years? <eos> They last played in 1997 against the Florida Marlins and lost.
No, not quite. This isn't one of those happy baseball stories. <eos> What happened, a scandal? <eos> No, a disease or two. First, diabetes.
No, a disease or two. First, diabetes. <eos> So he had to quit? <eos> Retire, you mean. Yes, he did. A sad day.
I would be excited if they played 500 baseball. <eos> How are they doing so far this year? <eos> Four games above 500.
They scored 5 runs. <eos> How did they do it? <eos> Two base hits, a walk and a couple home runs.
That was pretty awful, hopefully the indians replaced him this year. <eos> Have you gone and seen any games yet? <eos> No I havent yet.
I think most of us were. <eos> Did you hear that cheering? <eos> It went on forever.
Hard to talk about the AL without mentioning the Yankees. <eos> I know, right? What's going on there? <eos> Somehow they're cranking out wins left and right.
Somebody has got to lose. Fisher is pitching for the rocks. <eos> Who's pitching for the d back? <eos> Don't know.
Oh. <eos> What time do you want to leave? <eos> Really early,I want to see batting practice.
No way, they're giving him a day off. <eos> How did Billy Hamilton look last night? <eos> 0 for 7.
0 for 7. <eos> That's not good. So no stolen bases? <eos> No, none.
Oh, I  see. <eos> Who started for the Mariners? <eos> Oh come on, you know it was Paxton.
I think he's in Miami now. <eos> Soaking up the sun with the Marlins? <eos> Yeah, I guess so.
Well, A good seat near the field will cost around 50dollars. <eos> How much for a seat in the bleachers? <eos> The cheapest is around 10 dollars, in the nosebleed section.
He really is. I bet he'd make it on the team. <eos> Does he still practice? <eos> He does every few days with his friends.
We should tell Jenson too. He's a great batter. <eos> Remember that home run he hit last summer? <eos> That was crazy.
That was crazy. <eos> Did they ever find that ball? <eos> No, never.
Baseball is a slow sport to me. <eos> Relly. Why is that? <eos> I think the innings can be so long.
Yeah. It can. But it so much fun. <eos> What do you like about baseball? <eos> I like going to games. I love eating popcorn.
Yes. Injurys are serious too. <eos> When do they stopp playing baseball? 35-40 years old? <eos> I think so. 35 is good. They are millionaires by then.
That Bryce Harper extension was a shocker. <eos> In what way? <eos> The amount of money given to him.
Yeah but why not long term. <eos> Makes you think they dont want him around? <eos> Trout got a multiyear deal.
Well maybe they dont want to commit to him. <eos> How many guys are like him? <eos> He is a generational talent.
I think Kinsler is pretty good. <eos> How do you like Verlander? <eos> He's awesome!  Tigers are lucky to have him.
Wilson is still pretty new, but I think he shows promise. <eos> Do you know who the Tigers are up against next? <eos> Yeah, they play the Angels again tonight and then again tomorrow.
Barry Bonds, who hit 762 home runs in his career. <eos> Didn't he use performance enhancing drugs during his career? <eos> I'm not sure, but allegedly he did.
I agree, though that was before there were tests for steroids. <eos> Didn't Hank Aaron have the most hits all time also? <eos> Actually, no. That is Pete Rose who has the most hits.
No, no one can replace Jeter. <eos> What other teams do you like? <eos> I like the Mets.
Yeah, I do I root for both teams. <eos> Do you attend live games? <eos> No, I like to watch the games in sports bars.
Oh, beg pardon, I was talking to my parrot. <eos> That's weird. Your parrot a sports fan? <eos> Thats none of your business.
No, just ignore him. Two outs. <eos> What was that? <eos> Stop eavesdropping, I'm trying to have a conversation about baseball.
Deal with it. <eos> I can't, its rather remarkable really. Whats his name? <eos> Babe Ruth.
That would make it fare, but money talks. <eos> Who's getting paid the most? <eos> I don't want to find out.
He is sixth all time with 3,465 hits. <eos> Oh my! Did he get more hits than Hank Aaron? <eos> Actually, no. Aaron got 3,771 hits, which is third-most all time.
You're probably right. I bet they fade away before August. <eos> How about the Rockies? <eos> They are surprising as well.
The NL West is always a tough division. <eos> What's wrong with the Cubs? <eos> I don't know. They're not looking like World Series contenders.
I caught two games. <eos> What is up with the Cubs right now? <eos> I know. They are really struggling.
I really hope it's a temporary slump. <eos> Me too. What do you think of the bullpen so far? <eos> The pen is the only reliable part right now.
It would be between Francona and Maddon. <eos> What about Maddon do you like? <eos> He had success in Tampa and Chicago.
I disagree, that pitch was outside. <eos> How many homeruns do you think he'll hit this year? <eos> Hopefully more than last year.
Hopefully more than last year. <eos> Why didn't the runner tag up on that fly ball? <eos> I guess he didn't think it was hit deep enough.
They were John Smoltz, Tom Glavine, and Greg Maddux. <eos> Didn't they all pitch for the Braves at the same time? <eos> They sure did, and they even won a World Series championship.
Wow the Yankees are off to a great start. <eos> Yeah but how long can it last? <eos> What are you kidding they could win the world series.
That's just how their coach does things. <eos> Who will win the championship? <eos> It will probably be the Warriors.
Most likely not. <eos> Who's the best player in the league? <eos> Unless Lebron proves me he's not the best player, he is.
Unless Lebron proves me he's not the best player, he is. <eos> Who's the MVP this year? <eos> It's tough, but I have to go Harden.
It's tough, but I have to go Harden. <eos> Did you go to any games this year? <eos> Yeah, I have a partial season ticket plan.
Yeah, I have a partial season ticket plan. <eos> Who's the next coach that's going to be fired? <eos> I hope it's Casey for Toronto.
I hope it's Casey for Toronto. <eos> Who will win between the Spurs and Rockets? <eos> It'll be really close, but Rockets.
Yeah it doesn't look like anyone can beat those two. <eos> Who's better Steph Curry or Kevin Durant? <eos> Kevin Durant by a mile.
Kevin Durant by a mile. <eos> Do you think Paul George stays with the Pacers? <eos> No, I think he will be going to the Lakers.
No, I think he will be going to the Lakers. <eos> Will the Knicks every get good? <eos> Not with Phil Jackson running the team.
Not with Phil Jackson running the team. <eos> Any chance Westbrook leaves the Thunder? <eos> No he will stay because Durant left last year.
That's probably the last big moment of his career though. <eos> What makes you say that? <eos> Well, he's already 39 and he's been looking old this postseason.
Yeah, it's been pretty incredible so far. <eos> Who do you think is going win? <eos> I think the Celtics will take it in seven games.
Even better to see it in person. <eos> What?! You were there? <eos> Yes! Up in the nosebleeds, but the atmosphere was awesome.
Yes, after accepting Islam. <eos> how many children he has? <eos> He is father of 5.
Not really .I prefer college basketball more. <eos> What team do you watch? <eos> The Friars.
If you're not people take the ball from you. <eos> I see. How do you get better at that? <eos> I guess just practice. I will do that today.
I guess just practice. I will do that today. <eos> Do you want me to practice with you later? <eos> Sure. We can do that after dinner.
I have to work on dribbling too. <eos> Is that where you bounce the bal over and over? <eos> Sort of but there's more to it.
Sort of but there's more to it. <eos> Is that hard to do? <eos> Yes, kind of.
They need to change the three point line. <eos> Why? <eos> It disincentivizes fun play.
It disincentivizes fun play. <eos> What kind of play? <eos> It ruins fast play.
It ruins fast play. <eos> It means players have to be less aggressive? <eos> Kind of.
I think the movement is fine. <eos> Really? <eos> Like, the actual movement.
Like, more loops and careful movement. <eos> Well. I guess? <eos> They can move as slow as they want.
Yes, it was a great game. <eos> Who won last night? <eos> The 76er's won.
Yes they do.  They are amazing. <eos> Who is your favorite player? <eos> My favorite player already retired.  He was Michael Jordan.
Yeah, I loved him. <eos> How are the 76ers doing today? <eos> They are in 2nd place and strong.
Mine too. <eos> Have have you seen them in person? <eos> Yes, a few times.
I would have to go with Lebron James. <eos> I thought he was retired? <eos> Not really not yet. Maybe he will pull a Jordan.
You think so? I doubt it. He is pretty solid. <eos> You may be right. Do you follow his team alot? <eos> I do, I think I like his as well.
Yeah. He totally destroyed him. <eos> Now the Spurs play the Warriors, right? <eos> Yeah.
I think  the Celtics will go 4 to 3. <eos> You think they'll win? <eos> Yeah.
I mean that's fair, Thomas has been absolutely amazing. <eos> But so has Wall, right? <eos> Yes, both have been playing some amazing basketball.
Not really. <eos> Would you like to learn some basics? <eos> Sure.
I don't know about the latest game. <eos> With who? <eos> Celtics.
Celtics. <eos> What about them? <eos> You can tell they're losing their touch.
You can tell they're losing their touch. <eos> Because of the brain drain? <eos> No, defense.
They're interesting. <eos> Are they? <eos> They always do something different.
Were you drunk?  They'll never get past Cleveland. <eos> Did you see Westbrook shooting free throws last night? <eos> Yeah, he must have trained with Shaq'  -- many bricks.
Yeah. He totally destroyed him. <eos> Now the Spurs play the Warriors, right? <eos> Yeah.
I think the Celtics will go 4 to 3. <eos> You think they'll win? <eos> Yeah.
To me the best player is Patrick Ewing. <eos> Does he still play for them? <eos> No. He dose not. He was really good.
Yeah, I am. <eos> Oh, did you used to play? <eos> Yeah when I was a kid.
Yeah when I was a kid. <eos> Were you any good? <eos> Yeah, I was. I used to play against older people.
Yeah, I was. I used to play against older people. <eos> Cool! Did you watch the NBA? <eos> Yup, a lot.
Yeah, but he was totally different back then. <eos> How so? <eos> They used to call him the next Michael Jordan.
Sure it does, eliminate the first round. <eos> Why not have everyone make it at that point? <eos> Well that renders the regular season useless.
Yeah. He totally destroyed him. <eos> Now the Spurs play the Warriors, right? <eos> Yeah.
I think  the Celtics will go 4 to 3. <eos> You think they'll win? <eos> Yeah.
God, I know. <eos> Know what? <eos> They suck. They're gone.
They suck. They're gone. <eos> Really? <eos> They're absolutely dead.
I'm so ready for next year's college season. <eos> Why do you say that? <eos> I believe any number of teams can win the title.
Yeah. He totally destroyed him. <eos> Now the Spurs play the Warriors, right? <eos> Yeah.
I think  the Celtics will go 4 to 3. <eos> You think they'll win? <eos> Yeah.
I think the Warriors will win. <eos> Why? <eos> The warriors have too many weapons.
Only when they are on TNT. <eos> Don't you have direct TV? <eos> Yeah but I don't have the sports package.
Yeah but I don't have the sports package. <eos> Don't even get espn then? <eos> No but I still get to watch some games.
I agree with most of what you are saying. <eos> So say its Wizards and Spurs. Who do you want? <eos> Spurs just to have Pop show he can win with anyone.
I know, right over Avery Bradley too. <eos> Who do you think will win game seven? <eos> I think the Celtics will win.
Two days ago. With the Heat. <eos> What was crazy about it? <eos> He broke the backboard.
He broke the backboard. <eos> What? <eos> He broke the backboard again.
I know, it's nuts. <eos> They won, right? <eos> Yes, they extremely won.
I screamed. <eos> Seriously? <eos> I actually screamed.
Depends on the health of their players. <eos> Who is more imporant to be on the court? <eos> Embiid has to be.
Embiid has to be. <eos> Why do you think that? <eos> He is generational when healthy.
Yeah. He totally destroyed him. <eos> Now the Spurs play the Warriors, right? <eos> Yeah.
I think  the Celtics will go 4 to 3. <eos> You think they'll win? <eos> Yeah.
Yes, there is a club that meets once a week. <eos> Do you know how many people have joined this club? <eos> I'm not sure but it is very popular.
I think they meet at lunchtime. <eos> Do you know what day they meet? <eos> I believe it is on Wednesdays.
Yes, it is. <eos> Are you any good at baskets at least? <eos> Better than I am at dribbling.
They've been repaving the basketball field around our apartment. <eos> No way? <eos> Yeah, it's active.
It sucks. <eos> No it doesn't, what? <eos> It's not good at all.
He played for the Boston Celtics. <eos> Is he in the hall of fame? <eos> He certainly is, and his number was retired by the Celtics.
He certainly is, and his number was retired by the Celtics. <eos> What position did he play during his career? <eos> He was a forward.
The Lakers won the game. <eos> Really? What was the score? <eos> The score was 91 to 97.
I'm going to have to say D'Angelo Russels. <eos> Which one has the highest points for the team? <eos> Williams does, but I still like Russels.
No they have hockey and thats it. <eos> Yeah dont they want to expand? <eos> I dont think they are as focused on that.
He stinks. <eos> What? <eos> He stinks bad.
I know of them but not specifically, no. <eos> Does Durant still play for them? <eos> No, he's in Oakland now.
No, he's in Oakland now. <eos> Who's in Oakland? <eos> Oh, the Golden State Warriors.
Oh, the Golden State Warriors. <eos> Oh, OK. Do you miss the Supersonics? <eos> Yeah, I miss them in Seattle.
Yeah. I'm a sports guy. <eos> So, what do you like about basketball? <eos> I like when they kick the ball through the yellow posts.
I forgot about that. <eos> How do you forget about Draymond Green? <eos> Slipped my mind you could say.
Yeah. He totally destroyed him. <eos> Now the Spurs play the Warriors, right? <eos> Yeah.
I think the Celtics will go 4 to 3. <eos> You think they'll win? <eos> Yeah.
The game is just not the same anymore. <eos> Did you watch this week's Shaqtin' A Fool? <eos> The flop was hilarious.
No way, if he does I would be shocked. <eos> What happens to Cleveland after that? <eos> They suck forever.
I like Minnesota. <eos> Why? <eos> They've got crazy plays.
They've got crazy plays. <eos> Like, what? <eos> They always lose the plot.
They always lose the plot. <eos> In a good way? <eos> In a good way.
Me neither. <eos> Who did Cleveland lose though? <eos> Deli, but that's about it.
Yeah. He totally destroyed him. <eos> Now the Spurs play the Warriors, right? <eos> Yeah.
I think  the Celtics will go 4 to 3. <eos> You think they'll win? <eos> Yeah.
Definitely! I love looking at how teams call plays. <eos> Who do you think is the best rebounder the Celtics have? <eos> Probably Pierce, even though he's not a big guy.
Yeah. He totally destroyed him. <eos> Now the Spurs play the Warriors, right? <eos> Yeah.
I think  the Celtics will go 4 to 3. <eos> You think they'll win? <eos> Yeah.
They're doing stupidly well this year. <eos> They haven't lost yet? <eos> Not once.
Yeah. He totally destroyed him. <eos> Now the Spurs play the Warriors, right? <eos> Yeah.
I think  the Celtics will go 4 to 3. <eos> You think they'll win? <eos> Yeah.
injury, trash talking, the usual. <eos> have you played basketball lately? <eos> yes, I went to the court the other day.
so then let's set up weekend pick up games. <eos> like five on five? <eos> yeah, that works.
Me too, which is a shame. <eos> Why is it a shame? <eos> I just miss when the league was more competitive.
Pop makes sure his players believe in his system. <eos> Do you think they ever dip again? <eos> Sure, when he retires.
Sure, when he retires. <eos> Dont his assistants carry on his teachings? <eos> Well Brett Brown hasnt seen much success so far.
Its amazing in todays world. <eos> So are they the best dynasty ever? <eos> I dont know the Celtics and Lakers won alot more.
Do you have a team. <eos> For college or pros? <eos> Either.
Don't get me started  on my dumpster fire. <eos> What? You aren't happy with Butler? <eos> Well, I just think he is over rated.
Bring anyone you can think of. <eos> What if we get too many members? <eos> We'll hold tryouts then.
Yes I am. <eos> Who is your team? <eos> I am fan of Golden State.
I am a fan of the Cavs. <eos> Oh really? <eos> Yep, we'll probably be playing yall in the finals.
Yeah I do. <eos> Did you play basketball at all? <eos> I did a little bit.
I didn't make it that far. <eos> How far? <eos> I played JV a little bit.
I played JV a little bit. <eos> Were you any good? <eos> No, that's the reason I never made varsity.
Oh I see. <eos> Were you? <eos> I was okay, but was in a tiny high school.
I wouldn't count them out just yet. <eos> You think so? <eos> They could pull an upset and turn the series around.
Don't forget, the Celtics did have home court advantage too. <eos> You implying that my team can't win on the road? <eos> You said it, not me.
Yeah, I did. <eos> What did you think? <eos> I was pleased with the win.
There's a game on tonight. <eos> Wanna come to my place and watch it? <eos> That'd be great! I'd love to see it.
They're supposed to win this time. <eos> Who's supposed to win? <eos> The cardinals.
I am. Let's hurry up and get to the conference finals. <eos> Who do you like? <eos> Golden State will take it easily.
Yep, I like it quite a bit. <eos> Any team you like? <eos> I like the Hawks.
Cool, I like the Wizards. <eos> Does John Wall play there? <eos> Yeah that's right.
Yeah that's right. <eos> How are they doing? <eos> They're in the playoffs, but down to the Celtics.
They're in the playoffs, but down to the Celtics. <eos> What is it at? <eos> 3-2.
Yep. Total luck though. <eos> Remember Belinelli's shot? <eos> The one where he bounces it off backside of Morris.
Yeah I like it okay. <eos> Do you have a team you like? <eos> I tend to like the Clippers.
Yeah they had the talent just didn't go anywhere. <eos> Do you think they all stay again for another year? <eos> I can't see Blake and Chris Paul staying together no.
Yeah. He totally destroyed him. <eos> Now the Spurs play the Warriors, right? <eos> Yeah.
I think the Celtics will go 4 to 3. <eos> You think they'll win? <eos> Yeah.
Yeah. He totally destroyed him. <eos> Now the Spurs play the Warriors, right? <eos> Yeah.
I think  the Celtics will go 4 to 3. <eos> You think they'll win? <eos> Yeah.
It will be a great finals, but I don't think so. <eos> Because of Durant? <eos> Yeah, adding him to the Warriors is just too much.
I played in high school. <eos> Oh cool.  were you good? <eos> Yeah I was okay.
No man, I was bad lol. <eos> Did you play any other sports? <eos> No not really.
Yes I do. <eos> Do you have a team you like? <eos> I like the Hoosiers.
The Warriors. <eos> Who do you think they  will win over? <eos> The Cavs.
Oh okay. <eos> You? <eos> I like Louisville a lot, big Pitino fan.
Yeah. They've been able to make it work I guess. <eos> The Grizzlies were originally from Vancouver, right? <eos> Yeah I believe so.
The Cavaliers will probably end up playing Boston. <eos> You think so? <eos> Yeah. I don't think the Wizards can beat Boston.
I think so, too. I think Boston is overrated. <eos> Who do you think will win the whole thing? <eos> I am almost positive Golden State will.
I do like basketball. <eos> What time do you like? <eos> I like the Rockets.
Yeah. He totally destroyed him. <eos> Now the Spurs play the Warriors, right? <eos> Yeah.
Cool, me too. <eos> Do you have a favorite team? <eos> I like the Celtics.
Yo. <eos> How are you? <eos> All good.
All good. <eos> Same here.  You into basketball? <eos> Yeah I love it.
Yeah I love it. <eos> Got a team? <eos> I'm a Hawks fan.
James Harden is a beast. <eos> Yeah he is my favorite player? <eos> I like Lebron.
I like Lebron. <eos> Anybody else you like besides Lebron or Steph? <eos> Hmm let me think.
Yeah, he sounds like the obvious pick. <eos> Who do you want to see get it? <eos> Anyone but Isaiah Thomas.
Anyone but Isaiah Thomas. <eos> Isaiah's the new bad boy in the league, isn't he? <eos> Nah, he just needs to control his temper a bit.
I'd like to see Kawhi Leonard of the Spurs become MVP. <eos> What are his chances? <eos> I think he has a decent chance. He's team's highest scorer.
Lebron James will probably get it, though. <eos> When will the award be announced? <eos> After the end of season.
Yes, it's so much fun coaching a basketball team. <eos> Are you guys any good? <eos> We win most of the games.
That's great congrats. <eos> Thank you.  Did you play? <eos> No I never did I should have, it looked fun.
You a basketball fan. <eos> Yeah I guess so. you? <eos> Yeah I like basketball okay.
Yeah I like basketball okay. <eos> Do you like a particular team? <eos> I like Syracuse.
I like Syracuse. <eos> Oh like college? <eos> Yeah.
Oh okay.  I don't really follow college that much. <eos> You don't watch March Madness? <eos> Nope.
I just can't get into it. <eos> What is it about pros that you like? <eos> I guess the stars and the skill.
You should of really checked it out! The games were intense. <eos> Oh, how so? <eos> So many games came down to the last few minutes.
So many games came down to the last few minutes. <eos> They were that close? <eos> Yup, all the way to the end.
They were all really close to the start. <eos> But are there any specific amazing games? <eos> Just watch all of it, trust me.
No way.  golden State is too good. <eos> Do you think the Spurs can beat the Warriors? <eos> Yes, but it is not likely.
Yes, but it is not likely. <eos> Why don't you think so? <eos> Because the Spurs are much older and slower.
I know Webber's number is retired though. <eos> What about Bibby? <eos> I don't think his is retired.
I don't think his is retired. <eos> Do you think they will be rivals forever? <eos> Oh yeah, it's basically a NorCal and SoCal thing.
Okay, here is the ball. <eos> Thank you.  What's the score? <eos> I have three, you have two.
It was a pretty good shot. <eos> So now we are tied at 3? <eos> Yes, we are tied.
Yes, we are tied. <eos> Do you want to call it a game? <eos> Yeah, that sounds good.
Yeah, that sounds good. <eos> Can I have my basket ball back? <eos> Sure, here it is.  Thanks for the game.
Yeah I like it okay. <eos> Do you have a favorite team? <eos> I guess I like the Knicks.
Ouch. <eos> Why do you say that? <eos> They're awful.
I've seen a few Wizards games. <eos> Did you have fun? <eos> Oh man it was great.
Exactly, and he still is carrying his team all alone. <eos> What are you trying to say about Kelly Olynik? <eos> That he is terrible at basketball.
Yes I am. <eos> Who is your team? <eos> I like the Celtics.
So you think they are a shoe in for the finals. <eos> I mean yeah, who is going to stop them? <eos> I thought maybe the Rockets.
There is no chance of that. <eos> Why do you say that? <eos> Because the Spurs exist.
No way their bench is too weak. <eos> OK, lets say I agree.  What about the Cavs? <eos> Well I think Lebron is wearing down.
The one on Friday. <eos> Oh, yeah. They played the Royals, right? <eos> Yeah, I think so.
Yeah, I remember that one now. They lost. <eos> Do you know what the score was? <eos> I think it was 3-1.
I think it was 3-1. <eos> Ouch. Was it a close game? <eos> No, not really.
Well, maybe you're right. <eos> Of course I am. What time are you picking me up? <eos> I want to get there early so be ready by 6.
I want to get there early so be ready by 6. <eos> What seats did you snag? <eos> Third row.

Yeah I do. <eos> Who is your team? <eos> I don't really support just one team.
I don't really support just one team. <eos> Oh no? <eos> No, I just like seeing the stars play.
Yeah I am a fan of the superstars. <eos> Like who? <eos> I really like Lebron and Steph.
Yeah I like it too. <eos> Any team in particular? <eos> I like Michigan.
Also college is easier to route for for me. <eos> Yeah I get that.  So no NBA? <eos> No not really.
I think Eric Gordon will come up big for Houston tonight. <eos> Who is going to step for San Antonio? <eos> I think Danny Green will make some big shots.
I am a fan. <eos> Who is your team? <eos> I don't really have a team, but I like some players.
I don't really have a team, but I like some players. <eos> Oh okay, what players do you like? <eos> I like the superstars.
I like the superstars. <eos> Like steph and lebron? <eos> Yeah I like watching them play.
I have seen a few Hawks games live. <eos> Oh really?  How was that? <eos> It was a blast.
Not even close? That's not fair at all. <eos> What's so great about LeBron? <eos> I think he's a better overall player.
Not only that, there defense is really on point. <eos> Do you think there going to win the Championship this year? <eos> I hope so, that would be cool being thats my hometown.
Professional basketball playoffs. <eos> No, not so far. Have you? <eos> Yeah, my team is in the semi finals.
Yeah, my team is in the semi finals. <eos> What is your team? <eos> The Miami Heat.
The Miami Heat. <eos> Why do you like the Heat? <eos> Mostly because I grew up in Miami.
That makes sense. <eos> Do you play any ball? <eos> No, not really.
That's too bad. <eos> Why is that too bad? <eos> Me and some guys play a game on Wednesdays.
Oh, that could be fun. <eos> You want to try it? <eos> Sure, why not.
Not bad. <eos> Good.  Do you like basketball? <eos> I do.
Cool me too. <eos> Who is your favorite player? <eos> Lebron of course.
That's right! He grew up in the Wilmington, NC area. <eos> Didn't he go to school in North Carolina as well? <eos> Yes, Michael Jordan played at the University of North Carolina.
I think it's tonight. <eos> Is it in Cleveland or Boston? <eos> I think this one is in Cleveland.
So cut the season down and playoffs in half. <eos> And lose almost an entire season of ad revenue? <eos> They can make it up.
But I think the playoffs this year are an abberation. <eos> In what sense? <eos> They havent been competitive at all.
Yeah I think that it needs to be reworked. <eos> So you wouldnt eliminate it altogether? <eos> No I think that it could cause problems.
No I think that it could cause problems. <eos> Teams would just join up together? <eos> Yeah it creates a balance that you need in the league.
That doesn't bode well for the Celts. <eos> Yea. You think the Warriors are gonna sweep? <eos> I think so, no Kawahi no Spurs.
Yeah, he is out for the rest of the season. <eos> Wanna go to the bar and watch the NBA finals? <eos> Sorry,m hanging with my girl tonight.
Sorry,m hanging with my girl tonight. <eos> Who is your favorite NBA team? <eos> Oh, it is easily the Chicago Bulls.

It is too bad Isaiah Thomas got injured. <eos> He got injured??? What happened? <eos> He has a hip injury.
He has a hip injury. <eos> Will he play against the Cavaliers? <eos> No.  He may be done for the season.
Yea, they did and it helped. <eos> Do you think they are better from it? <eos> Have you seen them play? It sure looks like it.
Its June 22nd  at 7 EST. <eos> Where is the draft again? <eos> Brooklyn at the Barclays center.
I did. It was a sad sight to behold. <eos> What is going on with the Celtics? <eos> I think that they were simply overmatched.
No, but look at their strengths. They have LeBron James. <eos> LeBron James can't win it by himself, can he? <eos> No, but he goes a long way.
Yes. It was certainly closer than the previous two games. <eos> Who won? <eos> Golden State won. They are now up 3-0 in the series.
Golden State won. They are now up 3-0 in the series. <eos> What was the score? <eos> 120-108. San Antonio actually played closer than the score indicated.
120-108. San Antonio actually played closer than the score indicated. <eos> Did Kawahi Leonard play for the Spurs? <eos> No. He has an injured ankle.
Yep, it was pretty sad. <eos> Well, what can you do when the star player is injured? <eos> The bench players have to pick up the slack.
The bench players have to pick up the slack. <eos> Who on the Spurs bench can do that? <eos> The only player with a lot of playoff experience is Manu.
I think so. He is the best player. <eos> What do you think of the Clippers? <eos> They are unfortunate.
Yeah, they always choke at the end. <eos> Do you think Leonard will be back? <eos> Yes, but not this year.
Yes, but not this year. <eos> Do you think the Warriors will sweep the Spurs? <eos> Definitely. The Spurs are too shorthanded.
I agree. Really miss the days of Larry Bird coaching. <eos> Me too. When is the next game? <eos> Next Friday against the Chicago Bulls.
Yes, other than Lebron James. Not a fan of his. <eos> What team does he play for? <eos> The Cavs.
The Cavs. <eos> Have they played the Pacers this year? <eos> Yes, and the Pacers lost pretty badly.
Yeah,top performers last night. <eos> They won with 40 points difference, what kind of results, right? <eos> I now lead 2-0 in the series.
No way, I think that is Michael Jordan. <eos> Why? <eos> Well, he is a great baller.
Well, he is a great baller. <eos> How come? <eos> He can dunk.
Well that doesn't matter. <eos> Why not? <eos> Because dunking is not everything.
That is right, Jordan is done. <eos> Well, do you still like Jordan? <eos> Yes, he can dunk from the free throw line.
I think the Warriors will win this year. <eos> Why do you say that? <eos> They have the best team, I think. Curry is unstoppable.
It will be in interesting finish for sure. <eos> Yes, whats your pick? <eos> Warriors over Cavs in 6.
Both teams are really talented. <eos> Who is winning in the series? <eos> I think the Warriors right now but it's anyone's game.
I suppose so.  I don't think it's the same. <eos> Die hard Chicago fan? <eos> Nah, not really.  I just marvel at MJ's talent.
The finals will be good though. <eos> Who do you think will win? <eos> The Cavaliers.
I think Golden State will win. <eos> Why? <eos> Cause they have the top 2 players in the west.
Yeah, nothing you can do about that. <eos> Do you think both teams will sweep? <eos> Golden State, probably.
Golden State, probably. <eos> Not Cleveland? <eos> LeBron is good, but I think Boston will steal one.
Yeah, but that injury pretty much killed their shot. <eos> Who do you think will win it all? <eos> Golden State, they're looking for revenge after last year.
Yeah I know.  It was close though. <eos> What was the final score? <eos> I think it was like 78-75 or something like that.
I think it will be GSU and Cleveland. <eos> How many game will it go to? <eos> 7 for sure.
Yup! I've been following basketball for years. <eos> What's your favorite team? <eos> The NY Knicks.
The NY Knicks. <eos> Have they been doing well lately? <eos> ... No. Definitely no. They've been a trainwreck.
... No. Definitely no. They've been a trainwreck. <eos> That bad? <eos> Unfortunately, yes.
Unfortunately, yes. <eos> Why have they been doing so poorly? <eos> Mainly really, really stupid trades.
Probably, but I think there are better team-building strategies. <eos> What would you recommend? <eos> Building a team of good, young players.
Steph Curry hands down. <eos> So LeBron isnt on that list anymore? <eos> No his time has passed.
Yeah but hes that way because of his surroundings. <eos> So do the other players make Steph good? <eos> No hes the best pure shooter ever.
Swanigan led Purdue with 18 points. <eos> Who was Kansas' leading scorer? <eos> Mason and Graham each scored 26 points for Kansas.

My guess is the Cavaliers. <eos> Are you a fan of the Cavaliers? <eos> Not really, but I like LeBron.
Oh, I'm just not much of a fan of his. <eos> Who do you think is going to win? <eos> I think the Warriors are going to make it this year.
I think the Warriors are going to make it this year. <eos> You really think they are that good? <eos> Yes, I really do.
Yes, I really do. <eos> Did you just jump on the bandwagon? <eos> Maybe. I really like the way Curry plays.
Ugh. I think he's nothing but a showoff. <eos> Why do you think that? <eos> Look at the shots he takes.
Maybe, but I really hope the Suns get it together. <eos> How do we do that? <eos> Get rid of Bledsoe and Knight.
Me neither, it's better when it's just their team there. <eos> You think Westbrook will win? <eos> Yeah, and he deserves to win too.
I don't know, he flubbed that lay up. <eos> Did you see the Bulls play last night? <eos> No, man, I was watching the Knicks.
The Laker game was super great. <eos> Right? Did you see that three point shot? <eos> KD looked tired last night, but still scored the most points.
Golden State is lucky to have him. <eos> You think our team will make the playoffs? <eos> No, but the Thunder will.
I would package it for a proven star right now. <eos> Like Jimmy Butler? <eos> Maybe thats where they go.
I've herd that the LA Lakers will draft him. <eos> Will Lonzo Ball's father be a distraction for his NBA career? <eos> It's very likely, hopefully Magic Johnson can deal with him.
Yes, they should be able to beat them easily. <eos> Could Cleveland win if Kyrie Irving wasn't on the team? <eos> I don't think so, he's an important guard on the team.
I don't think so, he's an important guard on the team. <eos> Will Draymond Green be able to keep his temper in check? <eos> Hopefully he can because Golden State needs him.
Hopefully he can because Golden State needs him. <eos> Will LeBron James retire if Cleveland wins again this year? <eos> I think he will play for at least 2 more years.

June 26th, I wonder why they wait so long. <eos> How does the media actually vote? <eos> They use points awarded on a 5-3-1 basis.
Man he is a super human. <eos> Oh really is he big? <eos> No, he looks like a small guy out there.
Yes that is correct. <eos> What did he do in the game? <eos> He moves so well.
No way. <eos> Why is that? <eos> Because they don't play well.
But he is still effective in scoring points. <eos> How many points does he usually score? <eos> I'm not sure, around 30 per game.
Wow, so I think the Warriors are good. <eos> Do you think they will win the Championship? <eos> Ya I think they will.
Ya I think they will. <eos> Do you like their jersey colors? <eos> Ya their colors are good.
I don't think he will be back this year. <eos> How do you feel about the draft? <eos> Ball will go second I think.
I think that Fultz guy will go first. <eos> What team do you think will get better? <eos> The Timberwolves will hopefully get better.
I'm sure they will. <eos> Who is your pick next year? <eos> I think the Spurs will win it all.
It'll be UConn, Stanford, Notre Dame, or South Carolina. <eos> Every year? <eos> Close enough. Since 2000, UConn has won 10 champsionships.
The Cavs destroyed them. <eos> Just in game 1? <eos> No! Both game one and two.
No! Both game one and two. <eos> Were the games close? <eos> Ha! Not even.
Yes, I think so. <eos> Where would Avery Bradley go? <eos> Look to trade him.
Look to trade him. <eos> Trade your defense stopper? <eos> You gotta do something to get Fultz into the lineup.
You gotta do something to get Fultz into the lineup. <eos> But that for a rookie? <eos> Yea, hes got immense talent.
That is a long time. <eos> How many rings does he have? <eos> I think he has three.

Yeah, he could have never won a ring on his own. <eos> When is the next playoff game? <eos> That is tonight! Cavs play the Celtics at home.
That is tonight! Cavs play the Celtics at home. <eos> Do you think Paul George will stay with the Pacers? <eos> I hope so, but I can see him leaving.
I still don't believe they won't by almost 50. <eos> What do you think is wrong with Isiah Thomas? <eos> I think his sisters death is still effecting him.
What is potential when it doesnt translate to the court. <eos> Look, Embiid and Simmons together isn't appealing to you? <eos> No, it is, but I'll believe it when I see it.
I guess but dont go crazy. <eos> Add Lowry to that core and you're in the playoffs. No? <eos> I dont know about that, but maybe.

Yeah and I hope I win too. <eos> Any other good games on tonight? <eos> I don't think so.
The Warriors and the Spurs. <eos> Oh.  No, I didn't catch it.  Who won? <eos> The Warriors, 120 to 108.
No they have no shot at that. <eos> Do the Warriors go 16-0 in the playoffs? <eos> I cant see that happening.

I mean, I was, until these last three games. <eos> Just a fair weather fan? <eos> When you're getting beat that badly, yeah.
I know. Basketball is pretty silly. <eos> Yeah, what's the overall point anyway? <eos> Teamwork, and fun.
Good points. <eos> What do you think of the draft? <eos> Nothing, it's pretty pointless to care about who the Lakers get.
Exactly, Carolina also only hit 14% of their 3 pointers. <eos> How did they win this game shooting so poorly? <eos> They played smart by not turning the ball over.

Even the West has no competition though. <eos> What am I gonna watch? The spurs lose by 40? <eos> Yea, that isnt usual for them.
Yes, it was a great comeback by the Warriors. <eos> Did you see when Kawhi Leonard got injured? <eos> Yes, he landed on Pachulia's foot when he shot the ball.
No, he was already landed. <eos> Why would he want to do that intentionally, though? <eos> The Spurs were winning and Leonard is their best player.
It is quite a show. <eos> Is KD taking over? <eos> No they dont even need him to do that.
He does it with his shooting. <eos> How can he get open for a shot so consistently? <eos> He is really quick.
He is really quick. <eos> And he gets a lot of screens set for him? <eos> No he actually creates his own shot.

Let's practice right now. <eos> DO you have a ball here? <eos> I have the one from Dave and Buster's.

It does have some great songs! And some great catch phrases. <eos> Wasn't one of the songs a big radio hit? <eos> Yeah, I think so. Some famous singer made it super popular.
um... yes. <eos> Um Why is that? <eos> Because Disney own pixar. And pixar is one of its studios.
I love the mouse that reminds of zsa zsa gabor. <eos> I think she may have voiced that role, no? <eos> That would make sense so much alike.

Not really, however Disney movies are an exception. <eos> Oh, is that so ? Which song is your favorite ? <eos> It's actually a tie between two songs from the same movie.
Yeah, in the original story she dies. <eos> Who dies? <eos> Ariel! She goes to heaven, though.
They will be using CGI animals. <eos> Isn't that basically the same as animating them? <eos> Pretty similar I guess. But it will look more real.
Oh, her name is Aurora. <eos> Ah, gotcha.  Wasn't her dress blue? <eos> It was actually blue and pink.
I thought it was all right. <eos> Just all right? What didn't you like about it? <eos> Well, it didn't make sense to me.
Well, it didn't make sense to me. <eos> What didn't make sense? <eos> Well, a few things actually.
Yeah, it's getting ridiculous. <eos> So what are they complaining about? <eos> Well, the new Beauty and the Beast has a gay character.
Disney might be making that the next movie. <eos> Yes but what if Andy has a daugher? <eos> I think Andy's daughter would also play with the toys.
Tinker Bell, no question. <eos> Why Tinker Bell? <eos> Tinker Bell has that pixie dust. She can fly and everything.
Well you know what I always say, "Hakuna Matata". <eos> Are you seriously quoting me The Lion King mottos right now? <eos> Well I'd say Timon and Pumba knew how to live life.
So, I saw Maleficent when it came out. <eos> Oh, why? <eos> My wife wanted to see it.
I don't know, I tend to like the villains. <eos> Really? <eos> Definitely, they feel more dynamic for some reason.

I don't, but my children do. <eos> Have they seen Bambi? <eos> Yes, my daughter especially loves that film.
Wait, they are actually animating that one. <eos> Really, now? <eos> Yes, it's going to be called Gigantic.
Yes, it's going to be called Gigantic. <eos> When is it coming out? <eos> 2018, I believe.

Some characters just can't be replaced. <eos> What do you think about Lion King? <eos> Great movie! It made me cry.
But I'm not a fan of the overhype the movie got. <eos> Like it's popularity? <eos> I think it got very big, very fast.
I don't know it has been a while. <eos> Yea, 5 years, can you believe it? <eos> Not at all, man.
It was a good movie no doubt, but a bit overrated. <eos> I didn't think so.  Why is that? <eos> The actual story itself wasn't much different from most Disney stories.
I just didn't like the film.  It was boring. <eos> I completely disagree, why do you say that? <eos> It took forever to get to point.
It took forever to get to point. <eos> You mean that the island really wasn't bad, just misunderstood? <eos> Right.  Spent way too much time on Maui dinking around.
That is slightly surprising. <eos> What's your favorite Disney movie song? <eos> That's a tough one. I have two from the Lion King.
It looks fantastic from what I've read online. <eos> Who is directing it? <eos> According to imdb, Chris Bouchard and Blake Harris.

I like Cinderella the best. <eos> What about her do you like? <eos> Well, that's the very first princess movie that I saw.

No probably not. <eos> Aw, why not? <eos> I've never been a big fan of animated films.
It's not being released until November 2, 2018. <eos> That's a while off. Has a cast list been released yet? <eos> No not yet. The film is still in pre-production.

Thanks. <eos> Where did you get them? <eos> I got then at Ross.
I got then at Ross. <eos> Ross, really? <eos> Yes. They had a huge she sale.

They look right on you. <eos> Why do you say that? <eos> They are. Is it hard to walk in those.
I have no problem with that either. <eos> When do you want to go? <eos> No time like the present I guess.

Right. To each his own but I'll stick with white. <eos> Would you want beading like those pearls? <eos> Yes, probably, or crystals maybe.
Definitely. And there's no one type of fashion. <eos> What do you mean? <eos> Everyone has different ideas about what's fashionable.
Everyone has different ideas about what's fashionable. <eos> But aren't some people right and some people wrong? <eos> Not necessarily. Think about Project Runway. Sometimes the judges legitimately disagree.

I don't but I've noticed how good they look on you. <eos> Here's another one. Which is better? <eos> Get both. They're on sale.
I think maybe this red one. It's the right kind anyway. <eos> How about this orange one? <eos> Yes and it's a better color. Get it.
You'll look so cute, though. <eos> OK. How can I resist that? <eos> You can't. Now let's go before we find even more.

That's the spirit. Summer is for breezy fashions. <eos> Okay. Come shopping with me? <eos> What do you mean? You're supposed to shop from your computer.
And I'd like beading on the skirt. <eos> Maybe pearls? <eos> Maybe.
Maybe. <eos> Or crystals? <eos> I'm sure either would be fine.

If I was to get a new one, perhaps. <eos> But then don't you just love building a collection of bags? <eos> Yes, although I don't have room for them all.

I like number 6. <eos> Really? <eos> Yeah I think it was very interesting.
Yes I have it was one of my favorites. <eos> Do you remember the scene with the yacht? <eos> I don't recall that one.

It was good. The submarine scene was crazy. <eos> Which sequel did Gal Gadot's character die again? <eos> It was in Fast and Furious 6. Pretty sad.

Well the second one was pretty bad. <eos> That's the one with Ludacris? <eos> Yeah that's right.  It was pretty bad.
Oh, yeah! I love them. <eos> Which one is your favorite? <eos> I would say the first, but I also like Furious 7.
Yes.  Theyre great. <eos> What is your favorite? <eos> I think Tokyo Drift.

I'm not sure which ones I have. <eos> Which ones of... in the series? <eos> Yeah. I know I have the first 5 I think.
Hello. <eos> Do you plan on seeing the new fast and furious? <eos> I don't know.  Maybe if I'm bored one day.
I know what you mean. <eos> Are you going to see it? <eos> Yeah I think I might.
You could say that. <eos> You have seen the fast and furious movies right? <eos> Um, duh.
Yes I can't believe it. <eos> What was your favorite car? <eos> Mine was the red car Toretto had.
Yea, I saw the first couple I think. <eos> How did you like Tokyo Drift? <eos> It was not my favorite.
Yea. It felt a little out of place to me. <eos> Same. Did you see all of them? <eos> All but the last one that just came out.
The whole movie felt a bit sad though. <eos> Why is that? <eos> Paul Walker's death.
So I saw the new Fast and Furious. <eos> Oh, there's a new one? <eos> Yeah.
I just watched Fast and Furious. <eos> I've seen that movie. What did you think? <eos> I thought it was good.

There are quite a few. <eos> How many are they up to now? <eos> I believe this is the 8th one.
wow that is a lot. <eos> Do you think it will be good? <eos> I have no idea.
Yes. That film was directed well. <eos> What was the most suspenseful part of the scene to you? <eos> When they were about to go into that construction zone.
They sure are highly budgeted films. <eos> Do you think they will make a ninth film? <eos> No, I doubt it.
That doesn't make sense. <eos> Enough about me! Do you have a favorite character in it? <eos> Yeah. Mine's Dominic.
Yes and the first one is the best. <eos> How many directors did it have? <eos> There have been 5 so far.
I think I have. I liked them. <eos> Do they seem ok for kids? <eos> No probably not.
Ok. My son likes cars and was asking about these movies. <eos> How did he hear about them? <eos> His friend showed him some of one of the movies.
His friend showed him some of one of the movies. <eos> Oh and now he wants to watch the rest? <eos> Yeah exactly.
Yeah I would say the same about myself. <eos> Do you have a favorite movie? <eos> I liked the first one the best.
Otherwise the same crew - Vinny Diesel, Dwayne Johnson, Michelle Rodriguez. <eos> Who directed? <eos> F. Gary Gray.

I'm still going to go see every one they make. <eos> Are they making another one? <eos> Talking about it or a spin off series.
Yeah I did mostly because The Rock was in it. <eos> Isn't his real name Dwayne Johnson? <eos> Yes it is, he also used to wrestle in the WWE.
That was a really funny part. <eos> Did you know that part was improvised? <eos> No I didn't that's awesome.
No, there was a short called Los Bandoleros in 2009. <eos> Which movie did it come out closest to? <eos> I believe Fast & Furious.
I never seen any. <eos> What? <eos> That is true.
Hi. <eos> Do you have a favorite fast and furious movie? <eos> I like the first one.

Yeah. <eos> Why is that? <eos> It reminds me of being in high school.
It reminds me of being in high school. <eos> Oh is that how old you were when those came out? <eos> Yeah dating myself a bit, but I was.
I loved his car too. It looked really cool. <eos> Did you like Vin Diesel? <eos> Yes, he was really cool in this.
Yes, he was really cool in this. <eos> Was there anything you did not like? <eos> No, I thought the whole movie was cool.
It's under 10 seconds I think 9 seconds to be exact. <eos> Wasn't it a 1970 Dodge Charger? <eos> Yes, I believe so.
I wish I could say the same. <eos> You're not a fan? <eos> Not too much. Action movies just aren't my type.
No. <eos> Who directed it? <eos> Justin Lin.
Justin Lin. <eos> Who played the main charaacter? <eos> Lucas Black, with Natalie Kelley as his girlfriend.
Yes, sort of. <eos> Have you seen fast and furious series? <eos> I am not sure if I have seen the whole series.

No, he was doing xXx. <eos> Who directed? <eos> John Singleton.
John Singleton. <eos> Who was the hottie? <eos> The great Eva Mendes.
It was called 2Fast2Furious. <eos> Is that the drifting one? <eos> No, that was Tokyo Drift, the third in the series.
No I only saw a few of them. <eos> Did you see the first one? <eos> Yes but it was a long time ago.
Yeah, that way they could finish the movie. <eos> So is O'Connor killed off as a character then? <eos> No they played it as he retired.
She was in Avatar, too. <eos> Who is the cop's girlfriend? <eos> Jordana Brewster as Mia.
Yeah, that thing with his dad was scary. <eos> Did you like the date scene? <eos> Yeah, that explained the group and how they formed.
That just got me excited. <eos> Which of the last 3 was your favorite? <eos> Fast Five without a doubt.
It's ok but it's getting a little ridiculous now. <eos> What do you mean? <eos> They keep going more over the top with the action.
They keep going more over the top with the action. <eos> Oh, it's getting too unrealistic? <eos> Basically, yes, but it's getting too far away from its roots.
Hi. <eos> Do you like Fast and the Furious? <eos> Yeah I like some of them.
Yeah I like some of them. <eos> Which ones? <eos> I like the 4th and 5th movies the best.
I like the 4th and 5th movies the best. <eos> Which one is the one where they are in Brazil? <eos> That is 5.

I loved it. <eos> What did you love about it? <eos> I loved the characters, and the hot guys.
I loved the characters, and the hot guys. <eos> What about the cars? <eos> I loved the cars too.
Yes! and Fast & Furious 1,2,and 3 were great movies too. <eos> Do you like when they have all those drag races? <eos> Yes, Fast & Furious is a great movie.
Me too. I thought it was just a prank. <eos> So what will happen to current fast and furious movie? <eos> Yes, I had the same question.
Yes I love him. <eos> Do you think he's that awesome in real life? <eos> I hope so, he's so dreamy.
I hope so, he's so dreamy. <eos> Do you have a crush on him? <eos> Obviously I do.
Not really. <eos> Oh how come? <eos> I just thought it was too predictable for a action movie.
I just thought it was too predictable for a action movie. <eos> Oh like what do you mean? <eos> Like the explosions and the women crowding around races.
Like the explosions and the women crowding around races. <eos> Does that not happen in real life? <eos> Not that I know of.
Hey. <eos> What was the last fast and furious movie you saw? <eos> I just saw the latest one in theaters.
I just saw the latest one in theaters. <eos> Oh really? <eos> Yeah.
It was cool how it made him go way faster. <eos> Paul Walker? <eos> Everyone actually. They all used it.
It's pretty good, you should watch it. <eos> Didn't that come out a while ago? <eos> Yeah it came out in 2006.
True, that is a good point. <eos> Who is your favorite actor in the series? <eos> My favorite actor is the Rock.
I sue it in my class to teach irony. <eos> How do you do that? <eos> It's dramatic irony because we know something that the characters don't.
It's dramatic irony because we know something that the characters don't. <eos> Like that Paul Walker is a cop? <eos> Exactly.  Plus it's also situational irony.
Yeah the one in theaters now. <eos> No, I haven't.  Have you? <eos> I haven't either.
There are really just a lot of them. <eos> Do you like the new ones? <eos> I like the Rock, he makes them a bit more fun.
Fast & Furious is the fourth one. <eos> It was just called Fast & Furious? <eos> Strange name but that is correct.
Strange name but that is correct. <eos> Then what was the first one called? <eos> The Fast and the Furious.
The Fast and the Furious. <eos> So they just took 2 words for part 4? <eos> Yea, seems quite lazy or they ran out of ideas.
Hello. <eos> Have you seen any of the fast and furious movies? <eos> Yeah I've seen some.
I just watched the first Fast & Furious movie. <eos> Did you like it? <eos> Yeah it was really awesome.
Yeah it was really awesome. <eos> Wasn't Vin Diesel in that one? <eos> Yeah, I'm pretty sure he's in all of them.
No, but I saw other ones. <eos> How were they? <eos> They were really sweet.
They were really sweet. <eos> How so? <eos> Vin Diesel is just an incredible actor.
Yes I do. <eos> What is your favorite part? <eos> I like the part where they race through the housing construction.
If I'm being honest, it's just got to be Dom. <eos> Really? Care to explain? <eos> I just find him to be the coolest character is all.
Oh, I am so sorry.  You must regret that. <eos> I really do.  Have you seen the new one yet? <eos> No I haven't.  I doubt I will.
Hi. <eos> Do you like Fast and the Furious? <eos> Yeah I guess so.
Yeah I guess so. <eos> Any one that stands out as the worst? <eos> The second one or third one is pretty bad.
I love those movies. Honestly, it's my favorite film franchise ever. <eos> So you actually like the entire series, movie by movie? <eos> Yes. Well, there's one thing that kind of bothers me.
It is my favorite as well. <eos> What is your favorite scene? <eos> I love when they are robbing the trucks.
Yes, it has. It is a very lucrative franchise. <eos> Is The Rock in part 1? <eos> No, that one is just Paul Walker and Vin Diesel.
That is the eighth one, came out not too long ago. <eos> I have not seen any since Tokyo Drift? <eos> You stopped right when it starts to get good.
They were all good. <eos> Who was your favorite character? <eos> Paul Walker for sure.
They should really consider ending it. <eos> Have you been watching the newer ones? <eos> No I have not.
I think it's 2 Fast 2 Furious. <eos> Hmm, interesting choice. Any reason why? <eos> People tend to overlook it because it doesn't feature Vin Diesel.
I just saw Fast Five. <eos> Who directed it? <eos> Justin Lin.
Justin Lin. <eos> Any new actors? <eos> Dwayne Johnson plays a cop.
Dwayne Johnson plays a cop. <eos> Wow, the Rock.  What happens? <eos> Diesel and Walker steal $100M from a drug lord.
Hey. <eos> Have you seen the fast and furious movies? <eos> Yeah I've seen a few.
Yeah I've seen a few. <eos> Have a favorite? <eos> I like the 4th one.
I like the 4th one. <eos> That the one with the cartel? <eos> Yeah.
Yeah, I can see why you think that. <eos> What do you think was the worst one? <eos> Easy, that's Tokyo Drift.
Easy, that's Tokyo Drift. <eos> Is that the one with Lil Bow Wow? <eos> That's the one.
I'd like to think that they'll retire all of the characters. <eos> As in the same way they did with Brian's character? <eos> Yeah. Just write them into normal lives.
That's the one. <eos> What of it? <eos> It reminds me of Harry Potter.
I would be Severus. <eos> Oh really, why? <eos> I enjoyed his character and thought he was misunderstood.
Okay, but all the other Slytherins were evil. <eos> Do you think Horace Slughorn was evil? <eos> He was very selfish and narcissistic.
Yeah, I guess they had too much to wrap up. <eos> Didn't she end of marrying someone at Hogwarts? <eos> I'm not sure to be honest.
Yeah, and lets not forget the maze at the end. <eos> Who would have expected that lead to a port key? <eos> I know right?  And to the worst possible place.
You're insane. <eos> Hear me out.  He had a bad childhood, right? <eos> Right.
Right. <eos> He was an orphan, right? <eos> Right.
So I had a Harry Potter marathon the other day. <eos> Really? How many did you watch? <eos> I watched all eight, it took all day.
I just saw Harry Potter and Goblet of Fire. <eos> Number 4 in the series? <eos> Yes.
Yes. <eos> Another director from the first three? <eos> Yes, Mike Newell.
Yes, Mike Newell. <eos> Isn't Ralph Fiennes in that movie? <eos> Yes, as Lord Voldemort.
That is a tough question. <eos> How so? <eos> I liked them all, but for different reasons.
Harry complained way too much in this movie. <eos> You think so? <eos> Absolutely.  He basically screamed at his friends the whole time.
Oh that's easy to put it simply "your a wizard Harry". <eos> That was an awesome moment by why is it your favorite? <eos> That's when he finds out he's a wizard.
They do, but also happy ones too. <eos> Which was your favorite happy moment, in the movies? <eos> I would say when Harry first see Diagon Alley.
I haven't yet. <eos> Which one are you on? <eos> I believe I'm at The Goblet of Fire.
Really mine is Snape. <eos> Oh you got to be kidding. Why Snape? <eos> Because he is the ultimate conflicted character. He's bad and good.
Hello. <eos> Are you familiar with the Harry Potter world? <eos> Yeah sure.
Yeah sure. <eos> Who is your favorite character? <eos> I really like Hagrid.
Hah that is cool. <eos> What about you? <eos> I like harry of course.
Hi. <eos> Did you watch the harry potter movies? <eos> Yeah saw them all.
Yeah saw them all. <eos> Did you have a least favorite? <eos> I really didn't like the fifth one.
I was an adult when I finally seen Harry Potter. <eos> What did you think of the movies? <eos> To be honest, I thought they made no sense.
To be honest, I thought they made no sense. <eos> What! How do you think that? <eos> All the adults are insane. Especially the old wizard, principal guy.
Someone evil has to take his place. <eos> So then Harry's kids take up the fight? <eos> Yes, or maybe his grandchildren.
I like it too. <eos> Have you seen the Robot Chicken parody? <eos> No.
I loved all of them. <eos> If you had to choose, which one would you pick? <eos> I would have to say, Deathly Hollows part 2.
No, that's not his real family. <eos> It's not? <eos> No.  His mom and dad died protecting him.
The first movie was just so magical and wonderous. <eos> Ever wonder what would happen if Harry was sorted into Slytherin? <eos> I have thought about that many times.
Sirius Black. <eos> Really? <eos> Yeah, he's played by my favorite actor.
I would check out the first one. <eos> Why is that? <eos> The first one has action just like all the others.
I wish I had a fast broom. <eos> So you could sweep faster? <eos> No.  Imagine having a broom you could fly around on.
I liked the sixth one. <eos> What did you like about that? <eos> I liked the story of Tom Riddle.
Later Hermione obviously. <eos> Why? <eos> One, she's older, more devoloped and two, she fixes her hair.
One, she's older, more devoloped and two, she fixes her hair. <eos> Fine. Who's prettier, Later Hermione or Ginny? <eos> Hermione. Hands down and twice on Sunday.
You know, I don't get the whole Ron and Hermione thing. <eos> You don't like them as a couple? <eos> I just don't think they're compatible.
Hmmm...mabe the Leveosa spell. <eos> Which? <eos> The one that make stuff float.
The one that make stuff float. <eos> Oh, yeah. Why? <eos> So I could make myself fly.
Of course, who wouldn't. I have a heart. <eos> Would you rather the flying car, or the timeturner? <eos> Time turner BY far...you could go and do whatever you want.
I just saw Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. <eos> Oh, yeah. How did you like it? <eos> I thought it was great. Especially when Twilight died.
Hi. <eos> Do you like Harry Potter? <eos> Yeah sure.
I love all the movies. <eos> Which one was your favorite movie? <eos> I liked the last two.
Well, this one is about real-life students who attend magic school. <eos> A bit cliche, don't you think? <eos> Maybe, but it was a huge success at the box office.
Maybe, but it was a huge success at the box office. <eos> Will they make more? <eos> Maybe! I would reccomend you go see that one.
I didn't like the Ron Weasley. <eos> What? <eos> He was such a whiner.
'Prisoner of Azkaban' just because of Gary Oldman. <eos> He plays Sirius Black, right? <eos> Yes, he does. He plays that character so well.
Yes, with David Yates as director, once again. <eos> Doesn't Harry "die" in this one? <eos> Yes, he goes into limbo for awhile and sees Dumbledore.
I figured you would, being such a Potter buff. <eos> It's on the bucket list. Any good? <eos> Yeah, it was alright.
Yeah, it was alright. <eos> Just alright? <eos> Not as good as Harry Potter.
I'm Ron Weasley. <eos> And what does Heromine Respond with? <eos> Pleasure....still one of my favorite lines.
I've seen them all. <eos> What one was your favorite? <eos> I really liked the first one.
I've never read any of the books. <eos> Why haven't you read the books? <eos> I'm not much of a reader.
I'm not much of a reader. <eos> You can borrow it if you want? <eos> Yeah, why not.
I think she should have ended up with Harry. <eos> Like when they danced at the Yule ball? <eos> Yep. They were more equals.
Yes, directed by Chris Columbus. <eos> Isn't Richard Harris in that? <eos> Yes, as Dumbledore.
Yes, as Dumbledore. <eos> But he's gone now, right? <eos> Yes, he died shortly before release of the fim.
Well, I always thought the Ginny transformation was quite abrupt. <eos> What do you mean? <eos> Well, she went from all shy to being an absolute badass.
I loved the books and the movies are pretty good also. <eos> Do you like the acting? <eos> Snape is great and so is Daniel as Harry.
They picked great actors. <eos> What do you think of Emma Watson? <eos> I love her. She's in other great movies as well.
Dude, he totally owned that film. <eos> Where did he find the bravery? <eos> Who cares?  He looked great with that sword.
It's the book and the movie The Goblet of Fire. <eos> Which order is that one in? <eos> That's actually the fourth book and movie in the series.
Snape. <eos> Really, why? <eos> One of my favorite actors.
Allan Rickman. <eos> What else was he in? <eos> He was the bad guy in the first Die Hard.
Hello. <eos> Do you like the harry potter movies? <eos> Yeah sure.
Cool. <eos> What about you? <eos> Yeah I enjoy them.
Yeah I enjoy them. <eos> Do you have a favorite? <eos> I liked the third one a lot.
Mostly. I didn't love all the changes from the books. <eos> What changes are you talking aboout? <eos> Minor details like the color of Harry's eyes.
I never understood why Goblet of Fire was liked so much. <eos> Why didn't you like it? <eos> Just felt that the actual games took way too long.
Yeah, that was cool. <eos> Or the way he handled the water task? <eos> Yeah, that was cool too.
No. <eos> Have you seen any of them? <eos> I watched the first film.
I watched the first film. <eos> And did you like it? <eos> I liked the castle part.
I heard they based it on Oxford. <eos> Would you go to school there? <eos> It seems dangerous.
Me either, but there's no time like now to catch up. <eos> Haha, yeah. Who's your favorite character? <eos> I think Neville was my favorite by the end.
But the scenes of Dementors in the movie are really scary. <eos> I see. What is your favourite Harry Potter movie? <eos> The first one, the Sorcerer's Stone.
I just saw the third Harry Potter movie. <eos> Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban? <eos> Yes, that's it.
Yes, that's it. <eos> A new director from the first two movies? <eos> Right,  Alfonso Cuarón.
But he loved Lilly. <eos> Huh? <eos> Harry's mom.
Hey there. <eos> Do you know the harry potter world? <eos> Yeah pretty well.
I just saw the first Harry Potter movie. <eos> The Sorcerer's Stone?  I loved it.  Who directed it? <eos> Chris Columbus.
Yes, when he was a baby. <eos> How'd he survive? <eos> his mother saved him by sacrificing herself.
Yes, the spell rebound. <eos> What happened then? <eos> Voldemort was destroyed.
Voldemort was destroyed. <eos> How'd he keep on? <eos> His soul latched onto harry.
Of course not.  They would never sell that to children. <eos> Then why do they call it that? <eos> It is a catchy name.
One of my favorite actresses. <eos> Helena Bonham Carter? <eos> Yeah, she's good in everything she does.
Yeah, she's good in everything she does. <eos> Even Through the Looking Glass? <eos> One of the movies only redeeming qualities.
They were good, but not as good as part 1. <eos> Did you like how it all ended? <eos> Yeah, it was cool. I wish they kept making more though.
I just saw Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. <eos> I did not see that.  Who's the director? <eos> David Yates.
David Yates. <eos> Is that the one where Dumbledore is upstaged as principal? <eos> Yes, by Dolores Umbridge.

They were notably different. <eos> Did you have a favorite? <eos> The first one.
The first one. <eos> What happened to him? <eos> I think he passed away.
This may be unusual, but I like Snape. <eos> Well, that is different. Why him? <eos> He sacrificed so much in order to help people.
I particularly like the scenes where he's flying on the broom. <eos> That one. Was that from the first movie? <eos> Yes, I think so.
I would probably go with the last one. <eos> You're talking Deathly Hallows Part 2, right? <eos> Yeah.  Part 1 was super boring.
I just finished Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. <eos> What did you think of Umbridge? <eos> I hated her.
My favorite Harry Potter is the last one. <eos> It is divided up right? <eos> Yes, I like part 2.

Yes, directed by David Yates. <eos> Who plays Draco? <eos> Tom Felton.
Tom Felton. <eos> Does Harry fall for someone? <eos> Ginny Weasley, the twins' young sister.
Severus Snape as a character absolutely disgusts me. <eos> What! Why? <eos> Because he unapologetically abused his students for years.
So I'm a bit confused about Harry's parents. <eos> What part is confusing? <eos> His dad was a total jerk and his mom was nice.
i dont think so. <eos> What do you mean? <eos> he loved Lily Potter and Harry.
That's pretty cool. Hogwarts is in to diversity. <eos> So you think there was anything going on with Grindlewald? <eos> I don't know. It makes their interaction more interesting and tragic.
That was a really great one. <eos> Yeah loved it.  What about you? <eos> I don't think I have a favorite.
Yes, it's all about the money. <eos> Any good scenes? <eos> I like when they made six decoy Potters.

The Horcruxes. <eos> Right. Anybody get killed in this one? <eos> Dobby.

Yeah, definitely. It's basically home invasion, but the whole country. <eos> I only saw the first one. Did you see the others? <eos> Yup.

No, there was an older one. <eos> Oh, really?  What was it about? <eos> Some kids go to a wax museum at night.
Some kids go to a wax museum at night. <eos> Okay, and what happens? <eos> They get sucked into the exhibits.  Pretty much they die.
They get sucked into the exhibits.  Pretty much they die. <eos> Sounds interesting.  When is it from? <eos> I want to say the 80s.
I thought it was an OK movie. <eos> Why would you say that? <eos> I just think the premise was boring.
It's really freaky too. The monster is very scary. <eos> Can you recommend another movie like that one? <eos> Sure, try part 2 and 3.

Yes, it's one of my favorite horror-comedies. <eos> Should I see it? <eos> Well, sure. It's hilarious, super gory, meta, sexy, and fast-paced.
Point taken. But Samara was awesomely creepy. <eos> Yeah, is that where she crawled out of the screen? <eos> Yeah, but that's not what bugged me the most.

I did not like it. <eos> Same here. So, why is part 1 better? <eos> Because it has a cooler story line.
Hey. <eos> When was the last time you saw a horror movie? <eos> I watched Annabelle not too long ago.
It's very good. Such a new concept for a movie. <eos> What was your favorite thing about it? <eos> I really liked the plot. It was very thought-provoking.

I just saw Rabid. <eos> Isn't that an oldie? <eos> Yes, 1977.
None other. <eos> Any nude scenes? <eos> Just a few.
It's Great! Jordan Peele is clearly a horror movie fan. <eos> Why do you say that? <eos> You can pick out references to others classic horror movies.
Yes, I sure did Friday night. <eos> What did you see? <eos> I seen The Conjuring 2, it was better than part 1.
I couldn't stand her character. That annoying laugh. <eos> Did you like Captain Spaulding? <eos> No, he is just as bad.
Yep, his team is built to be bigger and beat ours. <eos> Do you think the Blues will go far? <eos> If their goalie stays hot, sure.
Sure. It would make jiu jitsu that much harder. <eos> What if hockey players were allowed to use jiu jitsu? <eos> I don't even think it would be hockey at that point.
Yes, he did.  I think it hurt his team. <eos> Did you see that he got a hat trick last night? <eos> Yeah, I saw that.
Yeah, I saw that. <eos> What is your favorite NHL team? <eos> My favorite team is the Vancouver Canucks.
I think Las Vegas and ice hockey are a strange match. <eos> Would you have traded for that goalie? <eos> With that Goals Against Average?  Of course I would.
Yes, without those players can get hurt badly. <eos> Did you ever get hurt while playing? <eos> I sprained my wrist once but that's it.
Yeah, it is. I'm bummed. <eos> Who'd they lose to, the Predators? <eos> Yeah, Nashville beat them 3-1.
Well he does it to himself. <eos> Are you saying hes played poorly? <eos> No, just that he hasnt shown enough.
True but he cant be. <eos> Oh yeah, do you think he plays it out? <eos> Its all guaranteed and not a 35 plus deal so yeah.
No, I have not. <eos> Really? Why not? <eos> I actually don't know how to ice skate.
Sure. <eos> So. Ice rink this saturday? <eos> Let's do it.
Yeah you never know with the NHL draft. <eos> Would anyone be able to start immediately? <eos> I think the first 2 picks are ready for the league.
Yeah could you imagine Gretzky playing in the AHL. <eos> Didnt he? <eos> Think he was in the WHL first.
Oh that's an interesting opinion. <eos> What team do you like best? <eos> I like the Avalanche.
Yeah, it was great. <eos> You like the fights? <eos> It's the main reason I watch hockey.
Yeah I did!  Can't believe how bad the Devils lots. <eos> Do you know where they're sitting in the Eastern Conference? <eos> Unfortunately they aren't doing so hot.  They're second to last.

Yea, some. <eos> Did you watch the game last night? <eos> I caught part of it.
To bad you didn't see the start of the game. <eos> Why? <eos> Someone took a check to the head.
That is a big deal. <eos> Who do you think theyll sign? <eos> Have to look at Kuznetsov. He's marquee.
They shoud look into Steve Mason. <eos> Philly isnt retaining him? <eos> Hes a UFA right now and they extended Neuvirth.
Well they eat goalies for lunch up there. <eos> Speaking of where's Bryzgalov? <eos> Somewhere in Russia talking about Bears.
Right, but I dont think its going to be that easy. <eos> Why do you say that? <eos> Owners can write it into contracts.
Should put them all through free agency. <eos> Yeah but what about the contracts? <eos> Never thought about that.
You should have called my wife. <eos> Why should I have called your wife? <eos> To tell me about the game.

Yes, and Sidney Crosby is still their star player. <eos> When is their first match? <eos> It is tonight at 7:00 in Pittsburgh.
I think the salary cap is going to kill that team. <eos> Why do you think that? <eos> They cant sign Kuznetsov.
They cant sign Kuznetsov. <eos> What about Orlov? <eos> They lose one of them in the expansion draft.

The played the Honda Center. <eos> Nice, what was the score? <eos> It was 5 to 3.

I think the Penguins will give the Senators a tough time. <eos> Tougher than the New York Rangers gave them? <eos> Yeah, definitely. Pittsburgh is a tough team to beat.

They left for Brooklyn and they didnt bat an eye. <eos> Do you think they would ever fold? <eos> No the team is too established to let that happen.
Oh god they probably dont want that. <eos> Who would? <eos> Looks like you have your tail between your legs.
I bet that gave Gibson a little bit of trouble! HA. <eos> What number is Forsberg? <eos> He is number 9.
They play tonight in Ottawa. <eos> Which team won game two of their series? <eos> Pittsburgh, so the series is even at one game apiece.
This is true. Pittsburgh is the defending Stanley Cup champion. <eos> Who did Pittsburgh beat last year in the finals? <eos> They beat the San Jose Sharks.
Its a 2 player draft anyway. <eos> Yeah who do you think is going first? <eos> No clue, either do the Devils.
I think you cant go wrong with either. <eos> Will either play this year? <eos> They both will contribute right away.
No idea when, just know thats how it is. <eos> Gotcha. Does Vegas have the first pick? <eos> No the Devils do.
I guess in the spirit of the lottery. <eos> When do the Flyers pick? <eos> Number 2.
The Golden Knights.  How appropriate for a team in Vegas. <eos> Did they get some good players? <eos> Just two.  I can't remember their names right now.
Just two.  I can't remember their names right now. <eos> Hey, did you see how Backstrom played in the series? <eos> He has really improved this year.
I mean their window is closing as Hank gets older. <eos> Exactly so why not start to rebuild now? <eos> They dont need a rebuild, maybe a retool.
They dont need a rebuild, maybe a retool. <eos> Would signing Shattenkirk help them? <eos> I dont see how it could.
I dont see how it could. <eos> How about signing a goalie? <eos> That would be right if Hank was on his way out.
Well they should draft now. Normally it takes time. <eos> What about Nash? <eos> Hes played up to his contract.
Yes! I do. <eos> What equipment do you need? <eos> You need a stick and a puck.
Yes! It is a fast game and action packed. <eos> Is it easy to get injured? <eos> Not really.

You should, I had a great time. <eos> Did you go with anyone or go by yourself? <eos> I went with my husband.
I dont even own a player. <eos> So why are movies still released in physical format? <eos> Beats the heck out of me.
Thats not enough though. <eos> So what else do they need to do? <eos> Nothing really, but millenials will stop paying to go.

Yeah, she was great in La La Land. <eos> Who wins? Maximus (Gladiator) or Achilles (Troy)? <eos> No brainer, Achilles. He's in his prime.
Yea, very good. <eos> Tom Hanks is in that right? <eos> Yea, he is the pilot.
Yes, I think that's what he means. <eos> How about Stand By Me? <eos> Oh that's a great idea! I hadn't thought of that.
He does sing actually! I was surprised by it. <eos> Surprised? Does that mean he was actually good at it? <eos> He wasn't the worst, but he wasn't the best.
Yeah that's because it isn't an X-men movie. <eos> But Logan and Xavier are in it, no? <eos> Yes but it's not about the X-men, they're disbanded.

Gross. I can't imagine weighing a 100 pound costume. <eos> Especially under those intense lights. Remember Toto? <eos> Of course.
I just wasted over an hour of my life. <eos> What are you talking about? <eos> Clown Town.
Clown Town. <eos> I'm almost afraid to ask but what is Clown Town? <eos> A crappy movie I just rented and will be returning immediately.
Not even one. Whole other  world. <eos> So there is no Death Star in Star Trek ? <eos> No. Just stars.  And beyond them in the movies.
No. Just stars.  And beyond them in the movies. <eos> Are the old movies the same characaters as the new ones? <eos> For the lost part the movies are kind of similar.
Well Tom Cruise is for sure signed on. <eos> Anyone else? <eos> I saw Val Kilmer tweet about it yesterday.
Yes, I really enjoyed it actually. <eos> How did the deal with no Paul Walker? <eos> Well, they made some vague references here an there.
No, it's not. <eos> Excuse me? <eos> It's not a horror movie.
That doesn't mean it's horror. <eos> So what genre do you think it is? <eos> It's a crime thriller.
You get a lot of things wrong, sorry. <eos> But at least we agree? <eos> Yes, it's a very good movie. The genre is just wrong.
It has Ben Aflek in it. <eos> Not Batman? <eos> Nothing like Batman.
Well, Star Wars and Dune are high on my list. <eos> Got it. Do you like Arthur C. Clarke? <eos> As in..
Its my favorite. Such a game-changer in the genre. <eos> What's so special about it? <eos> The scenes, direction, art, story, and a computer gone so wrong.
I watch it every time it's on tv. <eos> Oh yeah, you like it that much eh? <eos> Yeah, I must have seen it 50 times by now.
Yep. I do. <eos> What? <eos> You first.
Well, that doesn't surprise me. <eos> ok what's your idea? <eos> Life and death of the last Tsar family.
Maybe not but I think it would be great. <eos> Who would direct it? <eos> I would have Stephen Spielberg do it.

No, his last film was in 1999. <eos> What was it? <eos> Eyes Wide Shut.
There is not five anymore, there is only four. <eos> Oh really? <eos> Yes Camille left.
I thought it was just like watching the original wonder woman. <eos> Did you hear the movie was banned in some countries? <eos> No I didnt hear that.
Oh, I think I've heard of that one. <eos> It's one of my favorite movies. Have you seen Knocked Up? <eos> Yeah, and I really had a good time at that movie.
Good call. certain films call for daylight viewings. <eos> What is an example for you? <eos> Again stephen king, but the shinning.

Yeah, it was an unusual movie. Felt very out of time. <eos> Do you usually watch horror movies? <eos> Not all that often. I don't get scared very easily.
You should watch it. <eos> Why is that? <eos> The specific dialogue in the movie is taken from the book.
It is that and so much more. <eos> Is that why so many young guys like it? <eos> It is a testosterone filled adventure also.
I just watched a good comedy. <eos> What was it called? <eos> Rough Night.
The Pirates of The Caribean was really good. <eos> They made a new one again? <eos> Yes, it has lots of action.
Yes, it has lots of action. <eos> Does it have Will Turner? <eos> Again, will not spoil it, but it does have his son.

It made no sense. <eos> Why not? <eos> Well, the old ones were great.
Not in this film. <eos> Why not? <eos> He just runs around. There is a mummy, no real plot.
Love horror. Of course the 80s had the best horror. <eos> What's your favorite classic horror movie? <eos> That has to be Texas Chainsaw Massacre.
I'm excited to watch my favorite movie of all time tonight. <eos> What movie is it? <eos> The Wizard of Oz with Judy Garland.

Really good. You actually believe they're a couple. <eos> Will the movie make me cry? <eos> I didn't but my girlfriend sobbed so be warned.

I do think you are right about that. <eos> Or was Dino a brontosaurus? <eos> I don't know i am not a nerd like you.
I won't watch that on television. <eos> Huh? <eos> They cut too much out.
I own it on DVD anyway. <eos> Liked it did you? <eos> Best mob movie in my opinion.

Tim Burton actually did most of the concept art himself. <eos> He designed the odd look of the people and scenes? <eos> Yes, even the mad hatter, down to his hat.
Honestly I think Bill Murray is better in Rushmore. <eos> Seriously? <eos> Yeah, I mean, his character is just so wacky.
Yeah, I mean, his character is just so wacky. <eos> And Jason Schwartzman isn't? <eos> No, but, like, his character is supposed to be out there.
Yeah. I think so. <eos> Why? <eos> It's just the writing. It feels like he's taking more risks.
Bruce Willis was even in it. <eos> I forgot about that! The Boxer, right? <eos> Yup. Very good.
I own it. <eos> Could I borrow it? <eos> Even better, come over and we'll watch it.
You haven't seen Gremlins?! You would probably love it. <eos> Well, What is it about? <eos> It's about these cute little pets called furbies.

None can't truly compete with meryl. <eos> How can you say that? <eos> Streep is able to become the character. She can play anything.

You should definitely start with Interstellar. <eos> Why should I start with that one? <eos> It's a movie that just wows you at the end.
It's about an astronaut who is basically stranded on Mars. <eos> Is it a thriller then? <eos> I'd say it's a mix between a thriller and a comedy.
There is one you might like, called Donny Darko. <eos> Who is in that one? <eos> Jake Gylnhaal is the star.
Jake Gylnhaal is the star. <eos> Is it a romance? <eos> Not really, more of a dark fantasy.

Oh, well it wasn't really a remake. <eos> What do you mean? <eos> I mean, it's not like it used the same characters.
Well, it was a totally different idea. <eos> How do you figure? <eos> Well, the ghostbusters were girls.
Every idea borrows from something else. <eos> What do you mean? <eos> There's really no original idea with movies.

It should be perfect.  It really empowers women. <eos> Who plays Wonder Woman? <eos> Her name is Gal Gadot.
I think I had watched just the first two. <eos> Why only the first two? <eos> It just got old and gory.
Yeah, you're right on that one. <eos> Yeah, what's the fun if you know that everyone will die? <eos> You didn't know how though.
Yeah, just gory and overkill. <eos> Was that a pun? <eos> I didn't mean it to be.

It is a shame. <eos> Do you think it was portrayed realistically in the movie? <eos> Of course everything is exaggerated and dramatized in movies.
Still it is a bad job to have to do. <eos> Who directed this movie? <eos> Clint Eastwood was the director.
I liked the shopping scene. <eos> The part where Jennifer Carpenter was going nuts? <eos> Yeah that was funny.
Yeah that was funny. <eos> You know what else she was good in? <eos> Both Dexter and Quarantine.
Yes, Quarantine was scary. <eos> Have you ever seen Rec? <eos> Yeah, it's like the same movie but in Spanish.

It reminds me of that Nicolas Cage movie about cars. <eos> Oh, Gone in 60 Seconds? <eos> Yes, that one.  That was a good movie.
He was also in that movie Multiplicity. <eos> Was that the one where he had multiple personalities? <eos> Not exactly. He made clones of himself.
American Ghost Story if you're looking low budget still. <eos> What if I want to little more polish? <eos> Try the original Evil Dead, or Rec.
I plan to.  That's on my short list. <eos> You have any for me? <eos> Pontypool was good.  It's a different take on zombies.
Pontypool was good.  It's a different take on zombies. <eos> I saw that.  Any funny ones? <eos> Fido, that was a really fun one.

Yeah I did. <eos> Did you like it? <eos> It was alright but just missing so much.
I liked the story too. <eos> What was it then? <eos> I think they tried to make it too realistic honestly.
Crazy idea but works so well. <eos> It certainly does. Have you seen the sequel? <eos> Despicable me 2, yep, love it too.
Yeah, but it depends. I don't like cheesy scary movies. <eos> Well, have you heard of the movie It Follows? <eos> No I haven't.
No I haven't. <eos> Are you interested in hearing what it is about? <eos> Sure, go ahead and tell me.
Johnny Depp is such a good actor. <eos> He really is. Have you seen all his movies? <eos> I don't think all, but most, especially the more recent ones.
It also has Aidan Quinn, Mary Stuart Masterson, and Julianne Moore. <eos> Which one plays Joon? I'm guessing Johnny plays Benny? <eos> Mary plays Joon and actually Benny is played by Aidan.
Mary plays Joon and actually Benny is played by Aidan. <eos> So it's like a romance? <eos> Yes, but probably not how you're thinking.
Yes, but probably not how you're thinking. <eos> What does that mean? <eos> Benny and Joon are brother and sister, not a couple.
It's got Jim Carrey in it. <eos> Oh okay. Is that the movie where he's on tv? <eos> No. That's The Truman Show.
It has Kate Winslet in it. She's from Titanic. <eos> Oh neat! Is it a good movie? <eos> One of the best I've seen in a while.

Yes that is pretty good too. <eos> Did you see they are bringing a new one out? <eos> Yes I can't wait to see it.
A lot of his movies are good. <eos> Was the last Indiana Jones one, the one with this son? <eos> Yes I believe so.
Well shoot, I don't have to rent anything. <eos> Why you say that? <eos> Just bring it over and we can watch it together.

I am not sure I forget. <eos> Do you know who starred in it? <eos> There were several people.
There were several people. <eos> Who? <eos> I do not remember.
No, and I don't plan to. <eos> Why is that? <eos> Because, it is unrealistic.
I know, mostly that is all it is though. <eos> What new movie are you planning on watching? <eos> I plan on seeing the Alien movie.
Prometheus. <eos> I have not seen it? <eos> It is supposed to be a prequel to Covenant.
It is supposed to be a prequel to Covenant. <eos> Was it interesting? <eos> Yes.
I did and loved it. <eos> Do  you remember who the actor was that played deadpool? <eos> Ryan Reynolds I believe.
Yeah maybe if we're lucky. <eos> Do you think there will be more movies? <eos> Definitely it was a big hit.
$783 million I believe. <eos> How much did it cost to make? <eos> Around $60 million.
I think it does. <eos> Kevin Costner plays the FBI agent you were talking about? <eos> Yes, Elliot Ness, I think is his name.
Well, there's Splash. It's from the 80's but it's pretty good. <eos> Splash? Didn't that have Tom Hanks in it? <eos> Yes, Tom Hanks and Darryl Hannah.
Definitely!  Such a great film. <eos> Yes, I completely agree.  What 80's movies do you like? <eos> I like anything with John Cusack.
Yeah, the ensemble cast is great. <eos> Have you seen Step Brothers? <eos> Of course! And also Walk Hard.
This Is Spinal Tap. <eos> That's a great one! Do you like mockumentaries? <eos> Yes, but this is the best and the brightest.
That's a pretty good comparison I think. <eos> So you're game to watch them again? <eos> Yes, I also haven't seen them all how many are there.
Yeah, it was just as good. <eos> Are Bloom and Depp in it? <eos> Yep, so is Kiera Knightly.
I think the second Captain America was better than the first. <eos> The Winter Soldier? <eos> Yes, it showed so much more humanity with Steve Rogers.
Yes I know that. <eos> Do you have netflix? <eos> Yes, I do.
I don't know, I guess it just wasn't exciting enough. <eos> You mean the trailer or the buzz? <eos> Both, it was kinda quiet.
One of the funniest movies was on TNT last night. <eos> Yeah, what's that? <eos> Groundhogs Day.
He did. <eos> Chris Elliot was in it too, right? <eos> Yeah, the camera man.
The movie wasn't bad, don't get me wrong. Just not amazing. <eos> Did the story kind of follow different characters throughout time? <eos> Yep, that's how it went.
Yep, that's how it went. <eos> Who were the stars of the movie? <eos> Tom Hanks was probably the biggest name.
Yeah and then there was Rambo III a few years later. <eos> Oh right and didn't they do another Rambo fairly recently? <eos> Yeah, it wasn't that good. Stallone looked really old in it.
Yes, from movie goers. <eos> So your friends did not like it? <eos> Not just my friends, the reviews were really great.
Not just my friends, the reviews were really great. <eos> What reviews? <eos> I read some reviews on IMDB.
I guess we have to agree to disagree there. <eos> Why do you think he fit well though? <eos> He fits the physique and the egotistical attitude.
That's a fair point. <eos> Would you recommend the movie to people? <eos> Yes but only if they have nostalgia for the oldies.
So i was watching this movie called Lucy last week. <eos> How was it? <eos> Good. It was cool science fiction.
That movie that starred Brandy and Whitney Houston. <eos> That was a made-for-tv movie wasn't it? <eos> Yeah it was.
Yeah it was. <eos> What was the name of it? <eos> Cinderella.
Cinderella. <eos> Cinderella? <eos> Yeah.
Wow, he's done some big movies. <eos> Want to hear some Terminator 2 facts? <eos> Yeah, sure, lay them on me.
OJ Simpson was originally cast in Arnolds role. <eos> What, why didn't they use him? <eos> They didn't think OJ was mean enough to play the role.
Meh, I didn't like that one. <eos> What?  You're crazy, what did you like? <eos> I liked Super Troopers.
I liked Super Troopers. <eos> That was a good one.  What about Beer Fest? <eos> Also funny, all the same guys.
Really, I think it adds. <eos> Maybe you're right but who draws anymore? <eos> Sure, the computers seem to do all that for you.
I had a romantic date with Mike on Saturday. <eos> Really? Did you go out somewhere nice? <eos> Actually, no, we stayed home at his place.
I like how it showed how much they loved each other. <eos> Hudson and Whalberg's characters? <eos> Yes, even though they shared the screen very little.
Lake House. <eos> Who plays in it? <eos> Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock.
Well, what stood out was that the characters were too one-dimensional. <eos> Do you mean Becca, Anna Kendrick's character? <eos> Yes.  She was too self-centered and fake edgy.
That was indeed probably the movie's greatest weakness. <eos> Aside from that, what did you like though? <eos> The music mashups were all really well done.
I own the dvd. <eos> Do you like it? <eos> Dude, I said I own the dvd.
Dude, I said I own the dvd. <eos> So I'll take that as a yes? <eos> Yeah.
I saw it. <eos> Did you like it? <eos> I LOVED it.
OH my god get out of here. <eos> What? <eos> The original was so much better.
I don't know.  I guess we could look it up. <eos> Yeah.  Did you see any of the sequels? <eos> No, I didn't know there were sequels.
Yeah, last semester we had to watch Apollo 13. <eos> You never saw that before a few months ago? <eos> Nope. I've never been too big into movies.
Nope. I've never been too big into movies. <eos> So you really liked it? <eos> Yeah, it was great. I loved Tom Hanks in it.
Yes that one. The start of the Dark universe. <eos> No I haven't. Was it any good? <eos> Overall?.....No. It was not good at all.
Overall?.....No. It was not good at all. <eos> What was wrong with it? <eos> The story itself was very weak. Poorly developed.
Yes, it was a shame. <eos> Do you think he is the best Joker ever? <eos> Probably. Jared Leto was good too though.
His character was thin as a result. <eos> what about Nicholson? <eos> He was too cartoony.
Yeah.  I will have to explain it to you later. <eos> Would you recommend Baywatch? <eos> I would, just make sure there aren't any kids around.
I heard they are in talks for yet another Highlander movie. <eos> They made more than one? <eos> Yes, there six in all.
Yes, there six in all. <eos> What? All with Sean Connery? <eos> The second one had him.
It always reminded me a bit of Braveheart. <eos> With Mel Gibson? <eos> Yes, set in Scotland.
Yeah, so am I.  There's a sequel too. <eos> what's it called? <eos> The Brave Little Toaster Goes to Mars, I believe.
I know right. <eos> You saw it? <eos> Saw it? Man I virtually lived it.
I do. <eos> Did Eazy E really die from AIDS? <eos> Yeah. That was messed up man.
I did too, which was a surprise. <eos> Do you usually enjoy the movies your kids do? <eos> Not often.
Mine too they can't wait to see the other movies. <eos> There are more? <eos> Three in total I think.
I know right. <eos> Did you see that tv movie about Michael Jackson? <eos> Yeah I saw it.
I love the original Frankenstein. <eos> The one with Boris Karloff? <eos> That's the one.
He was in a lot of those classic  horror films. <eos> What do you think of Dracula? <eos> I think it was pretty good for its time.
He certainly is that. <eos> The cast is pretty strong, too, isn't it? <eos> It's a great cast.  They really fit their parts.
It's a great cast.  They really fit their parts. <eos> Isn't Judd Nelson in the film? <eos> Yes, he's really the best in it in my opinion.
It was directed by Joe Johnson. <eos> Who is that? <eos> He also directed the first Captain America movie.
Of course I do, a huge part of the movie. <eos> Which actors played them do you know? <eos> One was Joe Pesci and another was Daniel Stern.
I probably would have too. <eos> Did you know that Kieran Culkin played in that movie? <eos> No actually I did not know that.
She really is a brilliant actress. <eos> Didn't you like one of the actors in the film? <eos> Yes, Luke Williams who plays Gaston.
Yes. <eos> Where do you  go to see movies? <eos> I usually watch from home.
So do I. <eos> Are you going to see it? <eos> Sure, although I haven't seen the first one.
You should watch it first. <eos> Will not watching the first movie impact the second movie? <eos> No, I just think that it was very fun to watch.
No way. <eos> What? <eos> It's too unrealistic.
He was Lacey's ex-boyfriend from high school. <eos> But didn't Oliver help Lacey's school? <eos> Yes his company donated $100,000 to the city.
Fair enough. <eos> Wonder if they will ever do a remake of the movie? <eos> I doubt it.
Yeah it totally is.  It's on Broadway. <eos> Is it still playing? <eos> I'm not sure.  I'd love to see it if so.
I love all that old music. <eos> Can you believe Ricki Lake played Traci? <eos> No, that's crazy.  I used to love her show, too.
That one did have very good graphics. <eos> Did you see the one about Lincoln? <eos> Abraham Lincolc: Vampire Hunter.
I tried, but it was just so silly. <eos> Do you like more classic Vampire hunter movies? <eos> I am a fan of Van Helsing.
I am a fan of Van Helsing. <eos> That one had Kate Beckinsile in it right? <eos> Yes, and Hugh Jackman.
The rest dive deeper into the lore of vampire and wolves. <eos> Are they anything like Twilight? <eos> The exact opposite of that series.
No, it's with Will Ferrel. <eos> Is it animated? <eos> No, it's with real people.
No, it's with real people. <eos> What's it about? <eos> An elf who gets sent to New York City.
None that I know of. <eos> How long is it? <eos> Roughly two hours, I would guess.
Roughly two hours, I would guess. <eos> Is there a lot of Christmas music in it? <eos> Not particularly.
Not particularly. <eos> What's the elf's name? <eos> Buddy. He's Buddy the Elf.
Yeah. That's the movie that Robert Townsend made. <eos> Yeah that's it. Have you ever seen it? <eos> Yeah. That thing was funny.
Yeah. That thing was funny. <eos> What to you was the best part? <eos> I liked when they were playing the movie critics.
Jeff Goldblum. <eos> Awesome.  You know he's from Pittsburgh, right? <eos> No way, I didn't know that.
I bet not. <eos> What other movies do you like him in? <eos> Um... The Jurassic Park movies and The Fly.
I just saw The Third Man. <eos> I never saw it.  Who's in it? <eos> Orson Welles and Joseph Cotten.
Orson Welles and Joseph Cotten. <eos> Sounds cool.  Who directed it? <eos> Carol Reed.
Carol Reed. <eos> Based on anything? <eos> Graham Greene wrote the screenplay, then the novel later on.
He writes Westerns. <eos> Funny.  Who is Harry Lime? <eos> He is a racketeer. He is killed early on.
Yes, in those the story moves along though. <eos> Who do you think played their character the best? <eos> I would go with Ruper Grint.
I would go with Ruper Grint. <eos> He played Ron right? <eos> Yes, I think he was pretty much Ron in real life.
No they have a new actor playing the superhero. <eos> Who is it? <eos> Tom Holland... I believe it's his first big film.
Oh right I knew that. <eos> Do you like them at all? <eos> Not really. I think they're kind of stupid.
Me either. <eos> What did you think of the actor who played Christian? <eos> He was pretty hot actually.
Ha! That scene is such a classic. <eos> Wasn't that during the anchorman fight scene? <eos> It was! All the other actors coming in at once.
Yeah there are several storylines that are running throughout the movie. <eos> What's the main story? <eos> It's about corruption in Basin City, which is where it's set.
The acting was not that bad either. <eos> Did you see the sequel? <eos> No because none of the original cast was present.
Some never had careers besdies that movie. <eos> Did Travolta really sing in it? <eos> He would have made an album if he had.
I saw the best documentary on Netflix called Betting on Zero. <eos> Isn't that about the company Herbalife? <eos> Yes. It was fascinating.
Slowly but surely, yes. <eos> And do the aliens come in peace? <eos> That'd be telling. You should watch it and find out.
It's a new movie starring Jackie Chan and Pierce Brosnan. <eos> That's really cool.  Is it going to be a comedy? <eos> No, it's actually going to be a thriller.  Very serious.
And Anna who just wanted to spend time with her. <eos> Remember when Anna and Sven took off to find Elsa? <eos> That was quite an adventure.
Actually no. We flipped a coin. <eos> So what won? <eos> The went home and watched The Last Unicorn.
I like funny ones. <eos> Like National Lampoons? <eos> The ones with Chevy Chase, yes.
You know, there is even a newer one. <eos> Really? <eos> Yes, it had Ed helms in it.
Oh, I liked the vacation one. <eos> Which one? <eos> The one when the went to Europe.
Yes I liked him in that also. <eos> Did you see Deadly Adoption? <eos> no I didn't.
The first one is about seven hours I think. <eos> The first one? <eos> Yeah there's a few of them.
Oh The Sixth Sense. What a crazy twist that was. <eos> Yeah, remember everyone tried to keep quiet with that one? <eos> Yeah, but hardly any of my friends did.
Sure you did. <eos> Whatever happened to Bruce Willis? <eos> He's still around, but not doing too much work these days.
I just watched this new movie with Big Worm in it. <eos> You mean Big Worm from Friday? <eos> Yeah.
Yeah. <eos> Is it a new movie? <eos> Yeah. It's called Ripped.
Yeah. It's called Ripped. <eos> Was it good? <eos> I think so.
I think so. <eos> What was it about? <eos> These two dudes smoking weed.
Me too. But Beauty and the Beast is much better. <eos> Is it still a musical? <eos> Yes. And the songs are some of my favorite scenes.
I really like movies with zombies. <eos> Which one is your favorite? <eos> I think my favorite would be Night of the Living Dead.
I think my favorite would be Night of the Living Dead. <eos> The old one? <eos> Yeah, the original George Romero movie.
It's another zombie movie. <eos> Is it old too? <eos> Well, I think it was the late 80s.
Oh, it's pretty funny. <eos> I thought you said it was a zombie movie? <eos> Yeah, but it's hilarious.
Yeah, but it's hilarious. <eos> Is it scary at all? <eos> Not really.  It's kind of a zombie movie spoof.

Me too, they were called Gelflings I believe. <eos> How in the world do you know that? <eos> I honestly don't know, it just sorta popped into my head.
There were definitely some odd characters in that one too. <eos> David Bowie was in that movie wasn't he? <eos> Yeah, he and jennifer Connelly.

I finally got to see Batman versus Superman. <eos> How was it? <eos> Terrible.
They were so many things going on, I don't know. <eos> What about Wonder Woman? <eos> She was pretty dope.
Yeah, I bet it'll be better than Batman versus Superman. <eos> How much did they fight in the movie? <eos> Not much.
Not much. <eos> What do you mean not much? <eos> There was more talk in that movie than anything else.
Well documentaries don't but there subject matter does. <eos> How did you find that movie? <eos> I was just searching new releases on demand.
I did! I went with my daughter. <eos> What did she think? <eos> She thought it was really cute.

Yeah. I saw Arrival recently. <eos> Cool, what's it about? <eos> About Aliens who visit earth.

Be glad you didn't or you'll be like me right now. <eos> All the characters are there aren't they? <eos> The story line and character origins are all screwed up.
I love it. I have the first on DVD. <eos> I do too. Do you like the sequels? <eos> Some of them are OK. There are lots.
I don't like them all. <eos> How many have you seen? <eos> About ten different ones.
Yeah it gets way crazier too. You really should watch it. <eos> I'll give it a try. Any other good documentaries you'd recommend? <eos> Yes! There was another one called Tickled.
Mostly comedies, I also like suspense and horror. <eos> Have you seen "I know what you did last summer"? <eos> I have, it's a decent movie.
That would depend of the genre. <eos> Ok, what about Sci-Fi? <eos> I would have to say The Fifth Element.
I saw Girl on a Train. <eos> How was it? <eos> Pretty good, suspenseful.

It is the cutest movie. I just love it. <eos> Is that about the Hawaiian girl? <eos> Yes, I have watched it at least 30 times.
That's not as bad as people make it out to be. <eos> Why do you say that? <eos> It had some really good action sequences.
Me too. <eos> Was it comparable to the cartoon version? <eos> I actually think it was even better.
I saw the new Guardians of the Galaxy. <eos> I haven't seen it yet, is it good? <eos> Yeah, but not as good as the first one.
Yeah, but not as good as the first one. <eos> What are your top Marvel movies? <eos> I really like Civil War, that's probably my favorite.
Well, I guess the setting just worked for me. <eos> What, because it's like a Western? <eos> Yeah, that's probably it. And there was a much better plot.
What? Just okay? Pulp Fiction is infinitely better than Hateful 8. <eos> Well why do you say that? <eos> For starters, the scenery and story are more interesting.
Yes, a couple on vacation wake up and nobodies there. <eos> Was it good? <eos> It was ok, I hate those kind of endings though.
It was ok, I hate those kind of endings though. <eos> Did you see The White King? <eos> Yes, that was a weird one.

Yeah, I agree. He had a good run in the beginning. <eos> What's your favorite Kevin Smith film? <eos> Probably Dogma.
Addams Family Values is better that The Addams Family. <eos> Is young Vito Corleone your favorite Rober DeNiro role? <eos> It's tied with his Jake LaMotta role in Raging Bull.
Something funny. <eos> Any preferences? <eos> No. I like most comedies.
I'm sure. He's popular. <eos> Do you like him? <eos> He's funny but kind of ridiculous.
Neither do I but the movies are better. <eos> What's your favorite? <eos> Maybe Fifty First Dates.
My kids also liked that new movie trolls. <eos> I haven't seen that yet. Was it good? <eos> It's a really cute movie.
I love Thor. <eos> Well, since you asked, which actor? <eos> I love the way Robert Downy jr plays Iron man.
You should watch the trailer for it. It looks so scary. <eos> Is pennywise the clown in the trailer? <eos> Yes, Pennywise is in the trailer. He looks very scary.
It's directed by Kevin Smith. And it's insane. <eos> How do you mean? <eos> This dude turns another dude into a fraking walrus, man.
I know what you mean. I'm more into the supernatural. <eos> Yeah, me too. Like the Exorcist? <eos> Yeah. I love that one. I really liked Amityville Horror too.
Yeah I know. The movie is hilarious. <eos> What is it about? <eos> It's about two guys who get in trouble with the CIA.

Probably. <eos> You think they'll have advanced graphics beyond current realities? <eos> I hope not.
No! Let's figure this out. <eos> The Remnant? <eos> No it wasn't that it. The Verge or um eh....
I think I know a good thriller movie, the Invitation. <eos> I've heard of that, with the dinner party? <eos> Yeah man, that movie was super suspenseful.
Ryan Reynolds, nude for most of it. <eos> What kind of superhero movie is this? <eos> The kind that is awesome.
And Gus says...."By gol Woodrow, it's been quite a party."...... <eos> Doesn't that just tug at your heart? <eos> Totally.

That's it. <eos> So, what would Back To The Future 4 be about? <eos> Jules and Verne will be in their twenties and behaving irresponsible.
OH it's not scary. <eos> It's a marvel movie isn't it? <eos> The gardians is but nut rings.

That was a popular theme in movies from the seventies. <eos> What was the last good horror movie you watched? <eos> I really enjoyed It Follows, I can't stop thinking about it.
He was in Sixteen Candles before that. <eos> Sixteen Candles? <eos> He played one of the geeks, you know, Farmer Ted's friends.
I dont think thats accurate. <eos> Did you like Miracle? <eos> I did, I actually saw it in real life.
I did, I actually saw it in real life. <eos> You were at the game? <eos> No I watched it on TV.
Yes, I saw it last weekend. <eos> How did you like it? <eos> I thought it was very good. I saw it in 3D.
I didn't think it was anywhere as good. <eos> Why not? <eos> I thought the story line was much better in the original.
I thought the story line was much better in the original. <eos> Was there a lot of action in it? <eos> Yes, there was . It just didn't seem as well written.
I really like Man on Fire with Denzel Washington. <eos> Was Denzel Washington in that movie Deja Vu? <eos> He was, I watched it on Netflix last week actually.
My two little girls just loved Frozen. <eos> Did you see the new Beauty and the Beast? <eos> No, I haven't seen that one yet.
Really? I'm not so sure about that. <eos> Which one do you think will then? <eos> I think the new Spider-Man movie will be a huge hit.
Yeah, that will definitely give it a boost. <eos> Which summer movie are you looking forward to the most? <eos> I really want to see Dunkirk.
Yeah, I'm excited for that one as well. <eos> Which film is your most anticipated? <eos> I'm looking forward to Valerian.
I guess I can see that. <eos> What sequel are you most looking forward to? <eos> That's easy! I'm counting down the days until Wreck-It Ralph 2.
It brings people to the theaters. <eos> Does DC have a release schedule like Marvel? <eos> I dont think so, I know Wonder Woman is coming out.
I dont think so, I know Wonder Woman is coming out. <eos> And thats not held by a big actress right? <eos> Not big, shes been in some smaller stuff.
Yeah, Pulp Fiction was a bit gritty in the scenery department. <eos> What do you think his next movie will be about? <eos> Possibly something set in Europe.
I like the songs from Carousel and Grease but that's it. <eos> Not even the Disney movies? <eos> I don't count those as musicals. Some of them are good.
Ug, don't get me started. <eos> Do you at least like Idina's singing voice? <eos> No.
Thats a double standard for Hollwood. <eos> How so? <eos> Jim Carey has done many different films.
At least the new cast looks good. <eos> Really, who's in it? <eos> Danny McBride for one.
I think it is Casablanca. <eos> That's a really old movie.  Why Casablanca? <eos> Well, it has everything, mystery, suspense, romance, just a great picture.
Well, it has everything, mystery, suspense, romance, just a great picture. <eos> I've never watched it. Who's in it? <eos> It stars Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman.
It was made in the early 1940's. <eos> Is it a long movie? <eos> It's about average, a little over an hour and a half.
Some of his best work. <eos> Better than Billy Madison? <eos> I think so. Not as good as The Wedding Singer.
I was thinking you'd make a good Abigail Williams. <eos> Really? <eos> Yes, I see you playing her.
Yes, I see you playing her. <eos> Is that the one played by Winona? <eos> Yes.
Well you seem pretty excited. <eos> So want to watch it? <eos> I have nothing better to do.
Yes, I thought it was excellent. <eos> What is your favorite movie you've seen so far this year? <eos> Probably Beauty and the Beast.  It was visually stunning.
...I do know. <eos> Ok. Tell me. When did the genre of Horror movies begin? <eos> Let me see. Wait. I shall go look it up.
That sounds complex. I'll have to check it out. <eos> You should. What's the best movie you've seen recently? <eos> That's a tough question. Probably Deadpool.
Yeah, there were like four credit scenes in this one. <eos> Oh shoot, what where they about? <eos> Well, one of them featured a teenage Groot.
It stinks because movies like that become caricatures of themselves. <eos> Did you see the last one with the main cast? <eos> I did and thought it wasnt that good.
Not really. <eos> Why not? <eos> I hate movies with subtitles.
It's not a teen movie. <eos> Then what is it? <eos> Forget it.
Not exactly. I just like his manic energy. <eos> Maybe you liked Robin Williams, then? <eos> Sure, but his dramatic roles were always the best for me.
Yes, there's that and also Dead Poets Society. <eos> How about your favorite actresses? <eos> I've always been a fan of Penelope Cruz.
I heard about the Little Mermaid one. <eos> Do you plan to watch it? <eos> Probably but I won't be too hopeful.
Neither will I. <eos> How are they doing the underwater stuff? <eos> I have no idea.
Yes. They are. I just herad about a new one. <eos> What is it like? <eos> They have plush seating. Alcoholic drinks, and good dinner food.
Haha. I know what you mean. <eos> Whos is your favorite actor? <eos> I like Melissa Macarthy.
Well he does still fight villains. <eos> Who is supposed to be this one? <eos> Vulture I believe.
Vulture I believe. <eos> Any idea on the actor playing the role? <eos> Oh its going to be Michael Keaton.
Oh he will, probably stops at Infinity Wars. <eos> And then does what? <eos> Retires and enjoys his money.
You might like it then. <eos> Were the characters good? <eos> Yes, they were, but sometimes they weren't really fleshed out.
I don't know.... <eos> You should.  Have you seen the original ones? <eos> I did when I was younger.
I can see why you would say that. <eos> Did you see them? <eos> Yes, I thought the special effects were really great.
Yes, I thought the special effects were really great. <eos> Oh, do you like things like that? <eos> Yes, I think special effects make or break a movie.
That movie really needs to be on Netflix. <eos> Have you seen any movies in the theaters lately? <eos> No, the last movie I saw was Finding Dorry.
At the dollar theater in Allen Park. <eos> How much did it cost? <eos> It cost $1.50 because it was a night show.
They did a bunch of films together. <eos> Which one do you think was the best? <eos> I would say Pineapple Express.
The two most recent Star Wars films were really good. <eos> Defeinitely. Which one did you like best? <eos> I thought Rogue One was slightly better.
The bad guy in Nightmare on Elm Street is Freddy Krueger. <eos> Oh right, that was directed by Wes Craven right? <eos> Yes, he's a great horror film director.
Yes, he's a great horror film director. <eos> That is the movie where Freddy Krueger haunts dreams right? <eos> Yes, he haunts the dreams of teenagers. It's terrifying.
Yeah! I didn't like that too much. <eos> Well, you're a girl, it's understandable. Have you seen inside out? <eos> Oh my god. yes. that's the type of animations I like.
Hey thats not nice. <eos> Sorry. Is Hasselhoff going to be in it? <eos> Oh yeah I am sure he has a role.
Oh yeah I am sure he has a role. <eos> Maybe a cameo? <eos> I think theyd give him a bigger role than that.
The imagery was stunning, the plot not so much. <eos> Why was it not good Johnny Depp was in it? <eos> He did awful, nothing like his Pirates of the Caribean movies.
I think so too, especially all the characters. <eos> What about that movie, Why Him? <eos> I saw it but I wasn't too thrilled about it.
I think it's very catchy and I liked Justin Timberlake's song. <eos> Is it better than Moana? <eos> I can't compare them, but they're equally great.
Making a bad movie for Netflix. <eos> Why do you say that? <eos> He hasnt done anything thats been funny lately.
He hasnt done anything thats been funny lately. <eos> I suppose, what were your favorite films by him? <eos> I loved Billy Madison.
Oh that was great too, showcased his talents. <eos> How do you feel about Big Daddy? <eos> That was a good film and signaled his end.
I like True Grit a lot. That's probably my favorite. <eos> Have you seen the Coen brothers' version? <eos> Yeah, it was really good, but I still prefer the original.
Iron Man is good. Robert Downey Jr. is really funny. <eos> Any other ones? <eos> Captain America is good too.
I just saw that new Guardian of the Galaxy movie. <eos> Oh really? I can't wait to see that. How was it? <eos> You will love it. Fantastic.
You will love it. Fantastic. <eos> Better than the first one? <eos> I wouldn't go that far, but pretty close.
Probably the Harry Potter ones. <eos> Me too. Do you like the Hobbit? <eos> I guess but I prefer the books.
I hate cartoons period. Waste of money. <eos> Some are funny, did you see Sausage Party? <eos> I did but thats the exception to the rule.
What? No way. Why do yo think. <eos> Remember when he had the dream about the unicorn? <eos> Yeah, I remember. But why does that make him a replicant.
oh cool. Maybe I'll see it, I'm more into thrillers though. <eos> Oh, so whats your favorite thriller movie? <eos> I really liked Creep and Nocturnal Animals.
Very rarely, in my experience, do they have gore. <eos> Oh that's nice. What defines a thriller then? <eos> It's just the suspense and mystery that make your skin crawl.
Really?  Hmm.  I'll have to check that out. <eos> Have you seen Hacksaw Ridge yet? <eos> No, but I heard it was a true story.
Of course! You know I'm a sucker for Disney movies. <eos> Have you seen Moana yet? <eos> No, though I have been planning to.
oh yea, awesome. <eos> What was your favorite part? <eos> Probably the intro.  Baby Groot dancing was amazing.
Ha, the dialogue between her and Drax was epic. <eos> How about when baby groot kept bringing them the wrong stuff? <eos> Very funny.
Yeah, I've never seen it. I prefer romance movies. <eos> So you really wouldn't watch Jurassic Park? <eos> Too scary. I don't like to watch people get eaten.
Doesn't matter. It'll give me nightmares. <eos> Didn't you just watch the movie Saw? <eos> Yeah it was great.
Yeah it was great. <eos> And that didn't give you nightmares? <eos> Nope, I laughed through the whole thing.
They are stupid, except for posse. <eos> posse by mario van peobles ? <eos> yes it is so good.
I don't think it needs to be seen at the theater. <eos> So what did you think about it? <eos> I liked it, but I didn't love it.
I Just dont see it being relatable. <eos> How about Guardians of the Galaxy? <eos> Well I already saw that cause it came out.
The Rock is so boring as an actor. <eos> Did you like Fate of the Furious? <eos> No I think it sort of ran its course.
some guy died. <eos> who died? <eos> the master of obi wan kanobi.
So I watched Split the other day. <eos> Oh yeah? How did you like it? <eos> I liked it. It had it's moments.
I liked it. It had it's moments. <eos> Like what? <eos> Well, it was really long.
Well it happens to a lot of people in that way. <eos> So this movie was basically showing the evils of society? <eos> A little bit.
I like a few of them, but some are bad. <eos> Like which? <eos> That one with Adam Sandler.
I have a great theory about who he is. <eos> Really, what's that? <eos> Supreme Chancellor Snoke is ...
Yep, has everything you need in a film. <eos> And that is? <eos> Action, comedy, thrills, and romance all in one package.
I think you are too narrow minded about the SNL movies. <eos> Why do you say that? <eos> Because there were other comedies that came out.
Yeah. <eos> That's cool. It has the Star Trek guy right? <eos> Yeah, but he wears a mask.
I didn't really like it. <eos> Why not? <eos> Pretty boring.
I like comedy. <eos> Me too.what are your favorites? <eos> I love the wedding singer.
I love the wedding singer. <eos> Oh, nice. What else? <eos> Throw momma of the train.
I like then all. <eos> Movie buff huh? <eos> Yeah,I guess would have to choose drama.

Sure, it gives me a rush. <eos> What is your favorite? <eos> I like to go cop.
I like to go cop. <eos> Why? <eos> Not the be to go cop, the old one.
That's much better than the new one. <eos> Have you seen it? <eos> No.
We have one. He's called Jason Bourne. <eos> That's not really the same thing though, is it? <eos> It's as close as we're likely to ever get.
Yeah, and Zac Efron. <eos> I haven't, does it look good? <eos> No it looks pretty awful to be honest.
No, but they share a universe. <eos> So what does that mean? <eos> It means eventually we'll be getting a Godzilla vs. Kong movie.
It is, you should get it. <eos> Was there any nudity? <eos> Yes, I think so.
Definitely. <eos> What's your favorite movie of his? <eos> Inglorious bastards for sure.
It was good, I really liked it a lot. <eos> Great, how long was it? <eos> It was like two hours long.
Oh you should! I saw it and it was great. <eos> Did they do a good job with it? <eos> Yes, the music was fun and the story was interesting.
I didn't notice any. <eos> What was your favorite part? <eos> I don't want to give anything away.
Me neither. <eos> When does it come out? <eos> I think in Novevember.
Me too, he is probably my favorite character. <eos> Have you seen Guardians of the Galaxy 2? <eos> Yes! It was amazing, the effects were quite a visual treat.
I heard they used a lot of cgi. <eos> What is cgi? <eos> Cgi is computer generated image.
I like the girl that did the longpiece on Rent though. <eos> Gabby something? <eos> Yeah.
Oh it's brilliant. <eos> Is it about King Arthur? <eos> Yes, but when he was young, before he became king.
Exactly! And he's got an owl. <eos> Who, Arthur? <eos> No, Merlin. He's called Archimedes.
No, I haven't saw that one. <eos> What kind of movies do you like? <eos> I like comedy, romance and sometimes even horror movies.
I like comedy, romance and sometimes even horror movies. <eos> When was the last time you went to a theatre? <eos> It has been a while, probably 9 months.
Yeah, like Batman vs. Superman. <eos> I know, right!? <eos> I was keeping a Batman bodycount through the entire thing.
Agreed. <eos> What else did you like about it? <eos> I thought they paced the movie really well too.
They're just funny. And cute. <eos> What do you think of Captain Underpants? <eos> My kids enjoy the books, but I'm not fan.
I wasn't sure I would see it, actually. <eos> Why's that? <eos> Well, I've heard some really mixed reviews about it.
Yeah, soon after the car maker went under. <eos> That sucks, why? <eos> The maker was into drugs.
oh the one near the 6th street ... <eos> great ..do they have any other shows coming this weekend ? <eos> I think they have a midnight show this weekend ..
Yes. It is one of my favorite films. <eos> What did you like about it? <eos> First it was a different kind of role for Bruce Willis.
I just started watching the Fast and the Furious movies. <eos> How do you like them so far? <eos> Well, I've only watched the first four. I'm kind of confused.
Well, I've only watched the first four. I'm kind of confused. <eos> By what? <eos> A couple of things seem to be happening out of order.
Yeah, well. It's similar. <eos> So which Fast and the Furious movie should I watch first? <eos> The first movie is the first movie.
The first movie is the first movie. <eos> And then? <eos> The next one is 2 Fast 2 Furious.
The next one is 2 Fast 2 Furious. <eos> You said Tokyo Drift is the sixth part? <eos> Yep. So watch Fast & Furious instead.
I might watch it then. <eos> What about the Force Awakens? <eos> I saw that on opening day.
I saw that on opening day. <eos> What did you think of the Force Awakens? <eos> I thought it was a fun movie.
Yeah I saw The Last Jedi trailer. <eos> What did you think of the trailer? <eos> Looks pretty good. I'll probably see it in theatres.
First one. <eos> Why? <eos> I don't know. I guess it just feels the most cohesive.
The types of films being made. <eos> Do you mean like documentaries? <eos> Any kind.
Hmm.. Well they will come to you. Just don't overthink it. <eos> Anyway, what era is your favorite period of films? <eos> I like 50's the most.
Yeah, I saw 'Get Out'. <eos> Oh, I heard a lot about that! Jordan Peele, right? <eos> Yeah, he wrote and directed it.
Yeah, he wrote and directed it. <eos> Is it good? <eos> I loved it. It's kind of weird but really original.
I loved it. It's kind of weird but really original. <eos> Is it scary? <eos> Not scary so much as jumpy.
That's awesome. I'm excited to watch Dunkirk. <eos> Me too! Did Christopher Nolan direct it? <eos> Yes, same guy who did Interstellar.
Yep! I love all of his films pretty much. <eos> Have you seen Memento? <eos> No, I know it's Christopher Nolan though.
That's my favorite of his. <eos> I've heard it's kind of confusing? <eos> Not if you pay attention - it's a complex storyline though.
King Arthur was pretty good. <eos> I've heard good things. Who's the guy in it? <eos> Charlie Hunnam. The guy from Sons of Anarchy.
Huh, that makes sense. It certainly had some interesting sounds. <eos> Yeah, I've seen it. What did you think of it? <eos> It was definitely my kind of movie, I love hard sci-fi.
Your funny. <eos> Can you remember the name of the main actor? <eos> Tom cruise.
Yup,I have a pair not too long ago. <eos> Did you wish they had a party 2? <eos> That would of been nice.
You got that right. <eos> Can you name others? <eos> Maybe.
Yeah but not always the sad ones. <eos> Oh. What is your favorite genre then? <eos> Probably horror movies.
Probably horror movies. <eos> Oh, like the "Saw" series? <eos> Not really, those are just about gore.
Its not needed in these films. <eos> How do you feel about horror movies using it? <eos> Its important to show how vile some of the villains are.
Wow! I thought it was good, but not his best. <eos> Whatever. Well, what is YOUR favorite movie? <eos> Nothing beats Stepmom. I love my Susan Sarandon and Julia Roberts.
He was OK but not the greatest. <eos> Top Bonds then? <eos> I'd say Connery, Craig and Roger Moore.
The dark night. <eos> What? <eos> The dark night is a movie that dint suck.
No. But Paul told me it was good. <eos> Oh and Paul is a movie expert now? <eos> Yea, better than you probably.
Wow, interesting moral standards there. <eos> Yeah, I know, right? <eos> There were some downsides to the movie though.
I watched it last weekend. <eos> How was it? <eos> I like it. Nice New England flavor to it.
Me neither. But I tried to find the scene. <eos> You watched the movie? <eos> Well kind of. I fast forwarded through it once.
I couldn't find it! What a waste of time. <eos> That's too bad. So how was Manchester by the Sea? <eos> It was pretty good. One scene was just amazing though.
It depends.  I tend to like things from those genres. <eos> What about the Star Wars movies? <eos> Overall I love the Star Wars universe.
Sometimes but I like to read the book first. <eos> Why's that? <eos> It gives me insight into the characters.
Yeah, saw it opening night. <eos> You're so lucky! Any good? <eos> Yeah, It was pretty good.
Yeah, It was pretty good. <eos> As good as the first one? <eos> On par.
I think you'll like it. <eos> What's the name of the lead guy? <eos> Quill.
I finally broke down and watched Don't Breathe last night. <eos> How did you like it? Did you like it? <eos> No. I did not.
I don't think its mine but I really enjoyed it. <eos> Yeah whats your favorite movie? <eos> Mine is Artificial Intelligence buy Stephen Spielberg.
I really enjoyed it. <eos> What did your wife think? <eos> She liked it too.  She loves Chris Pratt.
She liked it too.  She loves Chris Pratt. <eos> Wasn't baby Groot adorable? <eos> Yup.  Definitely a highlight of the movie.
Yeah.  Marvel always does a great job with those. <eos> Did you see all the after credit scenes? <eos> Yeah.  We stayed all the way until the end.
Yeah that'd be good. <eos> What's it called? <eos> Betleguise 2, I think.
For one thing, you are a boy, Tommy. <eos> What's the other thing? <eos> Your sister is very emotional. Sad love stories make her cry.
But she knew it would make her cry. So... <eos> Why did she watch it? <eos> Yeah.
My favorite movie ever was a French movie. <eos> Really? What was it called? <eos> It's A Christmas Tale. It's a really weird story.
No you cant touch a film like that. <eos> Do you think he would ever reprise the role? <eos> Not at all.
Yeah, Guardians of the Galaxy 2 came out earlier this month. <eos> Man, there's so many I can't keep up. Which one's next? <eos> Spider-Man Homecoming, I think in Mid-July.
True, but I think Tom's going to do a great job. <eos> Wasn't he already in a movie? <eos> Yeah, he had a cameo in Captain America Civil War.
That's your favorite? Weird; mine is Indiana Jones, the first one. <eos> Okay, so, what do you think his best movie is? <eos> That's easy. Schindler's List, no question about it.
I'm not really a big movie fan. <eos> What? Why not? <eos> Well,I rather play or listen to music.
Sorry,I just don't see it. <eos> Do you like moves with musicians in it? <eos> I have not seen any.
I did! I was one of the first. <eos> What did you think?? Better than the first one? <eos> Definitely, I always love Chris Pratt.
I saw The Sound of Music and part of Grease. <eos> You didn't like Carrie Underwood's performance? <eos> I love her but she was not a believable Maria.
I love her but she was not a believable Maria. <eos> That's actually what I thought too. What about Grease? <eos> I hate Grease in all its forms.
There have been quite a few good movies this year. <eos> I really liked Split. Did you see that? <eos> I went opening weekend! Scarier than I expected.
Nice, who would you get to play you. <eos> Brad Pitt. You? <eos> Kurt Russell.
Yeah. He would be great to play me. <eos> Just for that? <eos> Yes.
Your right. <eos> Do you like him any other movies? <eos> Yes, the love boat.
Yes, the love boat. <eos> Your funny.so when do you want to get started? <eos> Tomorrow.
Yes, she's pretty legendary. <eos> Did you ever see Roadshow? <eos> No, but I saw her in a funny football movie.
I have some friends that do that sometimes. <eos> Exactly and what does it result in, usually? <eos> An awkward moment--even if anyone does.
I think Keaton killed the role as well. <eos> But you think it was better than Bale? <eos> They match up evenly.
Yeah I would agree that was a low point. <eos> Did you like Tommy Lee Jones as Two-Face? <eos> I could barely tell it was him.
It was like a boring version of the Comedy. <eos> The Comedy was by Tim, right? <eos> Tim and Eric Tim, yeah.
I hate it. <eos> Really? <eos> Yeah.
I couldn't stand it. <eos> But you liked Million Dollar Movie, right? <eos> Yeah.
I can't wait to see the new Harry Potter movie. <eos> I though they'd done them all already? <eos> This is a spin off—Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.
This is a spin off—Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. <eos> Like that charity book Rowling did? <eos> Exactly.
Exactly. <eos> So what's it about? <eos> I'm not sure. Some magical animal wrangler I think.
Well, I have and I will. <eos> What makes it so great? Clint Eastwood? <eos> No. The storytelling is what's so great about it.
Who cares. <eos> Right? <eos> Hah, you know he will.
Hmmm...I don't know about that one. <eos> Why not? <eos> I'm not really a fan of all these Disney, live-action, remakes.
It was okay, I guess. <eos> Was it as good as the original trilogy? <eos> I can't answer that without divulging into spoilers.
I can't answer that without divulging into spoilers. <eos> Well, how many stars would you give it then? <eos> Six.
Six. <eos> Really? Six? <eos> That's my personal rating. You might like it.
That's my personal rating. You might like it. <eos> So you didn't like it? <eos> Not really.
Evan Glodell’s going to be huge. <eos> Were there too many explosions, though? <eos> Too many explosions? How dare you.
Did you hear, they are doing another Dead Pool movie. <eos> Why? <eos> Why? Because Dead Pool was a hit.
Not me other than a few. <eos> Which ones? <eos> I like Carousel.
Ug, that movie is lame. <eos> Even the music? <eos> Well, the songs are OK.
Me too. I like her country songs. <eos> Country? <eos> Yes, look them up. 'Let Me Be There' is an example.
Its this movie based of a Stienbeck novel. <eos> Oh. Drama? <eos> Yeah, pretty dark at that.
I love bat man. <eos> Which is your favorite? <eos> I like the one with Michael keyton.
Your too much. <eos> Did you like any other bat man movies? <eos> Yeah,a few. I like the older ones.
It's Batman, come on. <eos> Why dissent he get shot in the chin? <eos> That's a good one.
It is, I just looked it up. Just an alternate title. <eos> Did you like it? <eos> Yes, it was good! I've seen a few of Lenzi's films.
Well, every character he plays is so different from the last. <eos> Example? <eos> He was Sirius Black in the Harry Potter films.
Dammit, Jim, I'm going to kill you. <eos> What about Deep Space Nine, though? <eos> Scotty, beam him out of my face.
Me too. She started singing and I was like, ug. <eos> Did you like the Cinderella one? <eos> No. I hated it. I didn't like that Mirror, Mirror either.
No. I hated it. I didn't like that Mirror, Mirror either. <eos> That was the Snow White remake, right? <eos> Yes.
Yeah, me and Harrison Ford watched Blade Runner together. <eos> Cool! Which version did you see? <eos> I don't know. The Blade Runner one.
Well, I don't know. <eos> Did it have voice over at the beggining? <eos> No, I dod not think that it did.
Well, then it was the director's cut, or the ultimate cut. <eos> The director's cut isn;t the ultimate cut? <eos> Brah, it's complicated.
Brah, it's complicated. <eos> Yeah, well, it's like dope anyway, you know? <eos> Daryl Hannah is great in it.
And I say no way. <eos> Have you even seen it? <eos> No, I don't like old movies.
Charlize Theron. <eos> I think I might have. Was Chloe Moretz in it too? <eos> Yes she was.
I love cartoon movies. <eos> Why? <eos> It's like a long episode.
Your funny, but it's true. <eos> Which one is your favorite? <eos> I seem to like tv show movies.
I seem to like tv show movies. <eos> Like the Simpson's? <eos> Yes, and the sponge Bob movie.
Yes, and the sponge Bob movie. <eos> Do you like Disney cartoons? <eos> Not really.
Well he always did good in specific roles. <eos> Like in Dude Wheres My Car? <eos> That was a good one for stoner flicks.
I thought it was okay. <eos> Just okay? What didn't you like about it? <eos> I thought the story felt a bit rushed.
I loved that the action was so believable. <eos> Yeah, that reminds me, did you see John Wick two? <eos> Yeah I did, I give it 7/10 stars.
Yes I have. <eos> What did you think of the movie? <eos> I thought it was really good.
Exactly. You just see the aftermath. <eos> What did you think of Mr. Blonde and the police officer? <eos> I thought that scene was really good.
Well, maybe we should watch that one tonight. <eos> That's about another missing girl, right? <eos> No, it's about a dead girl, actually.
Sounds good. <eos> Have you read the book? <eos> No, Gone Baby Gone I've read but not Mystic River.
Oh, no, wait. That was Brad Pit... <eos> Did you mean the Gringo? <eos> Oh yeah.
No, I was talking about Hacksaw Ridge. <eos> Was he in that? <eos> No, he directed it.
Oh yeah forgot about that. <eos> He also starred and directed Brave Heart? <eos> I had no idea! That was a good flick.
The animation was really great. <eos> So the clock and teapot were animated? <eos> Yes and it was really fun.
Very elaborate makeup. <eos> What did  you not like? <eos> I didn't really care for Gaston.
Yeah, that was a bit odd. I see that now. <eos> I'm glad you do. What did you like most about it? <eos> I loved baby Groot! He's so cute.

Princess Mononoke. <eos> Mononoke? Where the hell did I get hinomoke? <eos> From your brain.
Seems like they have one every summer. <eos> That's for sure. What's the name of this one? <eos> 47 Meters Down.
Not no much.  They are too long and too expensive. <eos> Do you like to watch TV or movies more? <eos> Neither. I prefer watching things on the internet.
I like good comedies. <eos> Do you like Adam Sandler movies? <eos> They are okay.  But I like Eddie Murphy movies more.
They are okay.  But I like Eddie Murphy movies more. <eos> Do you like animated movies? <eos> I like animated and anime movies.
Either is fine. <eos> Are you coming alone? <eos> Sure, if you want me to.
Oh yeah, that right. <eos> Did you like that movies major league? <eos> That's was a funny one.
It is supposed to have some good celebrity voices, too. <eos> Isn't Kevin Hart doing one of the characters? <eos> I think so.  And so is Ed Helms.
No, it would be a huge film. <eos> What actor would play him? <eos> Thats a tough one because he doesnt look like anyone specific.
Oh, no, I meant the most recent one. <eos> Rogue One? <eos> Yeah, that one! It was awful.
Yes. <eos> How do you know? <eos> It was on reddit a while ago.
Well, not exactly. Take the other Keanu Reeves move Constantine, though. <eos> He's been in a lot of supernatural thrillers, huh? <eos> Yeah, but you're missing the point.
Oh, the fight seen was just as funny. <eos> Do you remember the teams? <eos> It was the Dodgers and Angeles.
Your wrong. <eos> Who was it? <eos> It was the Angeles and the Marlins.
The juice. <eos> The juice? <eos> Yes,oj Simpson.
Way better. <eos> What about Jackie Brown? <eos> Yup. That one, too.
That's impossible. <eos> Why's that? <eos> Jackie Brown is criminally underrated.
Not really. <eos> Why do you say that? <eos> It seems like some of the movie looks over produced.
I think they do good with Batman but thats it. <eos> Did you not like Suicide Squad? <eos> No I though it was boring.
A bit mixed. <eos> How so? <eos> Well, "a bit" is just what it means...I like him mostly.
My favourite was The Neverending Story. <eos> With Atreyu and the luck dragon? <eos> Yes. He was called Falcor.
I agree. <eos> Why else didn't you like it? <eos> The plot.
The plot. <eos> What about it? <eos> It was not believable.
Yup,I like going. <eos> Why? <eos> I love the sounds.
That's not the only reason. <eos> Why else? <eos> The ticket prices.
Me too. I'm so pumped about it. <eos> Did you see how Bumble Bee pull himself back together? <eos> Oh my god, man. That blew my mind.
I hope they continue with this. <eos> What do you mean? <eos> I mean making Bee more than just a pretty car.
Give him substance. Make him someone the others will  follow. <eos> You mean make him the new Hot Rod? <eos> Why not? He already has the car.
Nice, I've only seen Zootopia and Kubo. <eos> Do you know which movie won? <eos> Yeah, it was Zootopia, to no one's surprise, I think.
I hate Herzog. <eos> Hate is a strong word, no? <eos> He's garbo.
He's pretty seriously emotive. <eos> And? <eos> Sentimentality is good, in my opinion.
I wrote treatments on him. <eos> How were those? <eos> They sucked. I hated them.
It just used the same formula from the first 2. <eos> Dont all movies like that do it? <eos> Yeah but this took it to a new level.
I went to the movies last weekend. <eos> What did you go see? <eos> I went to see that new Arthur movie.
Yeah, the movie was action packed. <eos> Was there much language in it? <eos> Only slightly that I noticed.
It was okay. Didn't much care for Batman v Superman either. <eos> Let me guess, you like Marvel films? <eos> Ha, no. I don't care for superhero pictures in general.
Definitly my favorite character. <eos> What was the deal with Captain Boomerang? <eos> Not sure. He was in the comics.
All of his movies seem to follow a parallel. <eos> What is that? <eos> Some bizarre head scratching thing happens quickly in the movie.
I have, I would not have the movie called a movie. <eos> What would you have called it? <eos> A motoon.
A motoon. <eos> Really? <eos> Yeah, it was a half movie and cartoon.
I saw it in theaters with my boyfriend. <eos> Was it any good? <eos> It was amazing! Especially the musical numbers.
That's no surprise. The humans are always at war. <eos> What are you saying? Humans don't like peace? <eos> Look around you and then you tell me.
Not really. <eos> Do you? <eos> No, I don't really care for them.
No, I don't really care for them. <eos> Why not? <eos> It reminds me of when I was a kid.

Exactly. <eos> Movies have no substance anymore. Who's the actress playing her mom? <eos> Goldie Hawn.
Yeah, I just saw the new wolverine movie. <eos> How was it? <eos> It was pretty cool, you gotta go and check it out.
Yes I did. <eos> What did you think? <eos> I thought it was a little lame.

Very lame, very lame. <eos> Did you like any of the King Kong movies? <eos> I liked the original one.
Yeah for kids maybe. <eos> OK, so Major League? <eos> Now that was a great franchise.
His career has really come full circle. <eos> How do you mean? <eos> You know, he played Batman, and now he's the bad guy.
He was. I think he played John Bigboote. <eos> Who else was in it? <eos> Well, John Lithgow played the villain.
Neither do I. <eos> Have your been to the movies? <eos> Only the oldest. She went with some friends.
Only the oldest. She went with some friends. <eos> Was she good? <eos> I think so. They saw the Lego Movie.

Because typically bands from this genre dont get in. <eos> Because they arent on a major label? <eos> No because they arent radio hits.

I like Jazz music. <eos> Really? Who's your favorite band? <eos> Steely Dan is one of my favorites.

They were a rock band from Los Angeles. <eos> Sounds cool.  Are they a new band? <eos> No, their first album was released in 1967.
Not really. Let's just see what's on. <eos> Sounds like country, that okay with you? <eos> I don't really care for country.
Sorry, I guess I'm pickier than I thought. <eos> How about this? <eos> The Beatles? I can get into this for a bit.
Here you go. No promises though. <eos> Ugh, can we just do NPR? <eos> Whatever you want.
Those were fan submissions. It was some kind of contest. <eos> What was your favorite fan submission? <eos> I like the claymation guy in the desert a lot.

I agree. <eos> What songs do you like for the guitar? <eos> Actually, when speaking about classical guitar, instrumental pieces are not songs.
You know what I miss? Doowop music. <eos> Like the 1940's and 50's type stuff? <eos> Exactly, that stuff had a different feel to it.

Yea, especially Doom.  He just keeps re releasing old albums. <eos> Yea, what was his last album, Born Like This? <eos> There was JJ Doom after that.

Yea I just recently watched Fist Fight. <eos> I have been wanting to see that one, how was it? <eos> I loved it; it was very funny and entertaining.
Me too. I hate how much traffic builds up on Fridays. <eos> So any plans for the weekend? <eos> Yeah a group of us are going to the movie theater.
Yeah a group of us are going to the movie theater. <eos> Sounds fun. Which movie are you seeing? <eos> We're checking out the new Marvel movie.
I need more. <eos> How about the year? <eos> That may help.
Alright, I've been busy. <eos> What you been doing? <eos> Working and spending time with the family.
Working and spending time with the family. <eos> What do you guys do together? <eos> We watched Aladdin the other night.
Good morning. <eos> Good morning, how are you doing? <eos> Pretty good, been a busy week.
Me too, I'm ready for the weekend. <eos> I hear that, what are your plans this weekend? <eos> Nothing really, I want to stay home and watch tv.
Are there any good movies coming up. <eos> The Thor/Hulk movie must be coming sometime soon? <eos> I was really disapointed in Logan.
Was thinking about going to the concert tonight. <eos> Yeah? <eos> Who's playing.
Great. I saw a good movie last night. <eos> Oh yeah, what movie? <eos> Get Out.
It is made by Jordan Peele and is a horror comedy. <eos> Cool. Is it very bloody? <eos> Not terribly. Some, it is a horror movie, but not bad.
I'm so glad. I'm so ready for the weekend. <eos> Yeah? Are you doing anything interesting? <eos> I might go and see a movie.
I might go and see a movie. <eos> Is there anything good playing? <eos> There's a lot out, actually.
Yes! It's really creepy and a little controversial. <eos> In what ways? <eos> There's some abuse and I guess mental illness stigmas.
Oh yes, those sound good. <eos> Do you have any plans for the weekend? <eos> I'm going to another concert, to see Kimbra.
Media is dying a slow death. <eos> And the special effects. Does anyone know how to puppet anymore? <eos> Everything looks fake these days.
Shes pretty good. <eos> Who do you like? <eos> Shania twain is one of my favorites.
Not too bad. <eos> Plans for the weekend? <eos> Not real sure.
Not real sure. <eos> Want to come over and listen to some tunes? <eos> That sounds alright.
Just keeping busy. <eos> Me too. Had any down time? <eos> I have a little. Been trying to fill it.
My down time I watched some movies. <eos> Oh yeah, like what? <eos> I just saw some old movie about a Princess, Princess Bride.
I just saw some old movie about a Princess, Princess Bride. <eos> The best movie ever. What you think of it? <eos> It was not what I thought it would be.
I liked the way the music was serious. <eos> The full orchestra and so on? <eos> Yes! The classical scoring, so fitting.
Yeah, with the family. <eos> What'd you guys watch? <eos> The new Pirates of the Caribbean movie.
The new Pirates of the Caribbean movie. <eos> Ohhh interesting. How was it? <eos> Honestly, not that good.
Honestly, not that good. <eos> No? Why? <eos> It was just wayyyy too long.
He actually does. The story revolves around his son though. <eos> I guess that could be fun. Should I watch it? <eos> Probably not in the theater. Save yourself some money.
It was really good, I saw it twice. <eos> It's a sequel, right? <eos> Yes, the first one came out a couple of years ago.
Yes, the editor seems to be expert. <eos> Okay, so do you want to hear catalyst right now? <eos> Sure, I would love to hear it right now.
Yes, I have a few degrees in it. <eos> What were your favorite- and least-favorite courses? <eos> SO many favorites, but I'd have to choose Advanced Analysis.
Well, I have two. <eos> And they are? <eos> Aesthetics and The Science of Music.
I saw an early screening last week.  I loved it. <eos> Really?  Warner Brothers finally made a good DC Comics film? <eos> I would say say they did an amazing job.
Gal Gadot did wonderful as Wonder Woman. <eos> Was that a pun? <eos> Sorry.  I had to say that.
Okay that sounds good. <eos> You see anything good lately? <eos> Not really, I want to go to the movie theater soon.
I don't know, I read he might have. <eos> But here's the big question: Dougie. Love or hate? <eos> Hate, so cheesy.
I am almost on the same page as you. <eos> Like physical DVDs? <eos> DVDs are even obsolete now.
DVDs are even obsolete now. <eos> So directly to Blu Ray? <eos> Not even a physical copy.
Not even a physical copy. <eos> So Netflix? <eos> Basically I can see it doing that.
Yeah but their pricing model will change. <eos> So how will they measure a movie's success? <eos> I believe you can pay to see the movie.
I believe you can pay to see the movie. <eos> OK wont that cripple the movie theater industry? <eos> Absolutely but they need to come up with creative ways.
Not really,I just worked with them a lot. <eos> Who was the best band to work with? <eos> Oasis.
Oasis. <eos> Why? <eos> Those guys knew how to party.
That sounds like a great reasons to go to matinees. <eos> What kind of movie would you liek to go see? <eos> I like all kinds of movies except horror type ones.
me too. <eos> You hear any new music lately? <eos> maybe let me think.
Yeah, I guess when you put it like that it is. <eos> Anyways, do you have Spotify and listen to any music? <eos> Yeah, I like listening to Throwback Thursday. That's always fun.
Yeah, I like listening to Throwback Thursday. That's always fun. <eos> Oh yeah, what is that? <eos> They play old music centered around a theme.
I know a great one you will like. <eos> What is it called? <eos> It is called Jiro dreams of sushi.
Yes it is about a guy who owns a sushi restaurant. <eos> Where is the restaurant? <eos> It is at the Tokyo Subway in Japan.
It is at the Tokyo Subway in Japan. <eos> He only has one restaurant? <eos> Yes, it is a small restaurant too.
Going to them. <eos> So you dont like the theater experience? <eos> I would rather do it in my home.
I just am not into special effects. <eos> Do you watch movies that have them? <eos> Yes and no.
They have them but the storyline is more important to me. <eos> Would you consider paying the same price at home? <eos> No because I dont have the requisite screen for the theater.
That's a good idea. <eos> Do you have a hard time falling asleep? <eos> Sometimes yeah.
He is wanting to be a songwriter/singer. <eos> Ok what else happens? <eos> They get together to break up later.
Oh right, that's the raccoon. I like him too. <eos> Did you see the first Guardians? <eos> Yes.
Yes. <eos> Did you like the soundtrack? <eos> It was pretty good.
It's one of my favorites of the series. <eos> Mine too, what's your favorite part? <eos> When they are being chased by the submarine through Russia.
So, I found this new genre of music.. <eos> New genre? what do you mean? <eos> It's called vaporwave, It's like an internet subculture.
It's called vaporwave, It's like an internet subculture. <eos> Internet subculture? <eos> Yeah, like a trend that started on the internet.
Not really at the moment. <eos> How about Baywatch? <eos> I think that movie is going to bomb.
He has become a meat piece for movies. <eos> Like he cant act? <eos> He can but its his body they want.
Oh wow! That's only the worst pick-up line I've ever heard. <eos> What's your sign? <eos> Ok. I take back my previous statement. That's the worst.
Ok. I take back my previous statement. That's the worst. <eos> Sorry, sorry. Seriously though, can I buy you a drink? <eos> What can it hurt. Sure.
What can it hurt. Sure. <eos> What are you having? <eos> I'll have a scotch.
Mine too. <eos> What do you like? <eos> I like the oldies, like the Beatles and Led Zeppelin.
It was underrated for sure. <eos> Is that so? <eos> Yes I really enjoyed it.
Hello. Yes it's been a bit. <eos> How have you been? <eos> Great. I just saw the best movie.
Great. I just saw the best movie. <eos> What was it? <eos> I went to see Guardians of the Galaxy 2.
It was just a little too simple. Everything was predictable. <eos> What did you like about besides the music? <eos> There is a lot to like. I especially like visual effects.
Yeah. It's been about six years. <eos> What ever happened with your girlfriend? <eos> We actually got married and had a little boy.
We actually got married and had a little boy. <eos> How old is your son now? <eos> He's five and has completely taken over control of the house.
I hate when actors are featured on it as well. <eos> Like who? <eos> Well Justin Timberlake for example.
Right but choose your lane. <eos> Why not do both if you can? <eos> SO then you are making a Disney movie.
Yeah, that's true. <eos> What about you?  What picks did you find interesting? <eos> I thought Joe Williams was a good pick, myself.
Maybe, I think they have a strong year though. <eos> How many games do you think they win? <eos> I'm guessing 12.
Steve Largent was an awesome receiver. <eos> Is he in the Hall of Fame? <eos> If not he should be.
Sounds good to me. <eos> What is your favorite team? <eos> The Patroits.
I agree, no one is like him. <eos> Have you been to any games recently? <eos> No I have not.
Yeah but hopefully next year I can go. <eos> Have you watched all of the games? <eos> Yeah.
I just think they really regress this year. <eos> Will Elway ever come down and coach? <eos> I think he likes being an executive more than that.
Yeah, I'll probably tune into a few. <eos> Oh, cool man. What's your favorite team? <eos> I like the Falcons.
I like the Falcons. <eos> Oh yeah? Are you from the Atlanta area? <eos> Yeah I grew up there, but now I live in Detroit.
Yeah, I'm a Patriots fan. <eos> Lucky you, still enjoying the trophy? <eos> Yeah right, that game was really crazy.
I have two, because I can't choose like that. <eos> Fair enough, what are they? <eos> My first is the Tampa Bay Buckeneers...
Yeah, they've won a lot I believe. <eos> Games? Superbowls? <eos> Well, obviously both if you win games to win the Superbowl....
I just saw the 2014 AFC Divisional Playoff game. <eos> The Patriots against the Ravens? <eos> Yes, a good one.
If memory serves, he did not even watch the whole thing. <eos> Did he even make it to half time? <eos> I believe he said that was when he turned it off.
The Chiefs and Patriots. <eos> Where at? <eos> At the  Patriots home stadium.
Right. And the athletes get paid more money. <eos> They do. So what team do you root for? <eos> Well, I really like the Seahawks.
Well, I really like the Seahawks. <eos> Why the Seahawks? <eos> I'm from Seattle, so it's a hometown pride sort of thing.
I'm going to a few of the Dolphins games this year. <eos> I am too. You get tickets already? <eos> Yes, I'm going to see them play the Bucaneers.
Yeah they will. That's why I chose that game. <eos> You gonna paint your face? <eos> No, that's a bit too far for my taste.
You're not wrong there. They are definitely top three. <eos> Who do you think has them beat? <eos> In terms of defense I would say the Seattle Seahawks.
Oh only one of the worst teams ever. <eos> Why do you say that ? <eos> Because they had a very big losing streak last year.
Their whole defense makes me want to punch something. <eos> Why is that? <eos> Because they are always talking trash.
Yes, but it will be worth it. <eos> True, but what should we do until then? <eos> I think we should support the team.
Yes, all owners choose values for their business. <eos> And, the Raiders most value toughness? <eos> I think so. But, they are also famous for being wild.
Good guess, but no. <eos> How about the Presidential Inauguration? <eos> That isn't it, either.
That isn't it, either. <eos> OK, I give up. What is it? <eos> Superbowl.
He already had a kneecap injury. <eos> Did it require surgery? <eos> Yes, two surgeries.
Yes, two surgeries. <eos> But he came back? <eos> Yes, he healed very quickly.
Yes, he healed very quickly. <eos> But what happened next? <eos> He just tore his ACL.
Right. <eos> So, he's out for the season? <eos> Yes, unfortunately.
And don't say the Browns to be a troll. <eos> Dang! How'd you know? <eos> You're predictable. Go ahead.
Yeah, me too. <eos> What did you think of their draft choices? <eos> I thought they were pretty good, but time will tell.
Patriots. <eos> Because they keep winning? <eos> Yeah.
I am going to the game. <eos> Really, where did are your seats? <eos> 20 yard line, not bad.
20 yard line, not bad. <eos> Why do you like the dolphins so much? <eos> Its my home town team, and because of ace venture.
It doesn't matter, team spirit. <eos> Do you like any other teams? <eos> I like the lions.
I like the lions. <eos> Is that an NFL team? <eos> I really don't like you right now.
I really don't like you right now. <eos> Falcons, Broncos? <eos> I like them, I like everyone in the AFC East.
I like them, I like everyone in the AFC East. <eos> Did you get me a ticket? <eos> Of course I got you a ticket.
Of course I got you a ticket. <eos> When do we leave? <eos> We are in the car already.
Richard Sherman is still a shutdown corner. <eos> But wasn't he almost traded? <eos> But he wasn't, he's still there.
Oh, he was a good quarterback. <eos> But you don't like him? <eos> I don't really like his politics I guess.
I am not too sure about him I like Evan Mathis. <eos> Yeah he is good but what about Demarco Murray? <eos> He has had some awesome touch downs in the past.
Yes, but I'd have such confidence it would be cool. <eos> Who would you like to pass to? <eos> I would pass to Smith or Huff.
I think this is the Vikings year. <eos> Really? <eos> Yes, I love their team.
Mike Glennon will never be good. <eos> Hah! Who do you have coming out of the AFC? <eos> Brady just keeps going and going, like the Energizer Bunny.
Well, he couldn't just be good out of no where. <eos> I supposed. But then tell me, why isn't Eli so good? <eos> I think he's good. He won a superbowl after all.
No, I want to watch them lose. <eos> Why do you want to watch them lose? <eos> The ownership is a pathetic excuse for existence.
I haven't heard anything. <eos> You know he injured his knee in December? <eos> Yes, but I don't think he had surgery.
For another year. <eos> Is his contract up? <eos> This is the last year on it.
There was a time when pigs bladders were used in footballs. <eos> You're joking, right? <eos> No I'm serious.
The odds are 1 in 17,420,000. <eos> Have you been reading up on football trivia again? <eos> I confess that I have.
Really. <eos> Yes, why do you not? <eos> No.  I do not care for him at all.
No.  I do not care for him at all. <eos> What is your issue with him? <eos> I think he acts like a baby.
He is a good player. <eos> Who is your favorite? <eos> I am a fan of Antonio Brown.
He did change the direction of any team he played for. <eos> What about Michael Irvin? <eos> He has got to be up there on the list.
Okay. <eos> What team is your favorite? <eos> I like the Buffalo Bills.
Oh cool. <eos> Yeah what is yours? <eos> My favorite player is Jeremy Butler.
Give me New England any day. <eos> Now who's jumping on the bandwagon? <eos> I've liked them for a few years.
That would be great. <eos> Who would you want to see? <eos> Either one. I'd love to go to a pro football game.
Vince Lombardi is an all-time great. <eos> Who did he coach? <eos> He coached the Green Bay Packers.
He coached the Green Bay Packers. <eos> When did he coach? <eos> His best era was the 1960s.
His best era was the 1960s. <eos> What happened then? <eos> The Packers won 5 championships in 7 years.
Yes, and those championships included the first two Super Bowls. <eos> I see. Who else had similar accomplishments? <eos> There are not many other NFL coaches with such a resume.
There are not many other NFL coaches with such a resume. <eos> You can't think of any? <eos> Well, Chuck Noll comes close.
Well, Chuck Noll comes close. <eos> Who did he coach? <eos> Noll coached the Steelers in the 1970s.
Noll coached the Steelers in the 1970s. <eos> What did they accomplish? <eos> They won 4 Super Bowls.
I do. It's my favorite sport. <eos> Did you watch the Super Bowl last year? <eos> Yeah. I watch it every year.
Yeah, I only wish it were the Broncos playing instead. <eos> You're a Broncos fan, I take it? <eos> Big time. I was disappointed with last season.
NFL season's coming up. I sure hope my team does well. <eos> You're not still a Ram's fan; are you? <eos> What else would I be? They just had a bad season.
I think the Patriots win the most. <eos> Oh yeah, is that so? <eos> Yeah, they are like always winning.
Well, hard contact is what appeals to many fans--that's the game. <eos> But what about the concussion issue? <eos> Very serious, obviously.
For sure--that's where the future players and fans come from. <eos> Is the NFL doing anything about it? <eos> Well, as you know there have been rule changes.
I think a less violent game would deter many fans. <eos> Yeah, what would be the attendance for a flag football game? <eos> It's a tough situation.
They sure pump up the spirit. <eos> Yep, what's football without a band? <eos> It wouldn't be the same.
I know. <eos> How did they get so good? <eos> They have top talent.
Yeah, I am, got some new jerseys too. <eos> Cool, whose jerseys did you buy? <eos> Odell Beckham Jr and Eli Manning.
Yes. It wouldn't be a stomp but the Browns would lose. <eos> What factors makes you think the Browns are the worst? <eos> In my opinion they need a serious roster change.
They draft very well. <eos> So you think they already drafted their guy? <eos> No I think they will address it in a few years.
Me either. But that was a strange game. <eos> It ended in a tie, correct? <eos> I believe it did. Something like 6-6 or 9-9.
Oh the Falcons. That was such a sad Super Bowl. <eos> It really was. Did you watch it? <eos> A little bit. It was rather depressing.
I just heard startling news about the NFL. <eos> What was it? <eos> 80% of players go broke after the first 5 years.
Well, I think they might actually have a chance. <eos> A chance for what? <eos> Maybe making it into the playoffs.
Reggie would out jump people and make himself a bigger target. <eos> What about Marvin? <eos> Marvin Harrison was more of route runner.
I want more than the division. <eos> What do you mean? <eos> I want them in the Super Bowl.
I miss Peyton Manning still. <eos> Well, who wouldn't? <eos> It's a shame he didn't retire a Colt.
Especially the colts alot have retired. <eos> Who has retired? <eos> Pat Mcaffe has retired.
Pat Mcaffe has retired. <eos> Wow he did? <eos> Yep! Just last year.
I sure am. <eos> Are you more into college football or NFL football? <eos> I'm an NFL guy all the way.
I'm an NFL guy all the way. <eos> Who is your favorite team? <eos> I'm a Carolina Panther fan.
I do too. <eos> Think the Panthers can win the division? <eos> It's probably a bit of a long shot but maybe.
It's probably a bit of a long shot but maybe. <eos> How many games do you think they win this year? <eos> I'm guessing 9, but I'm hoping for many more.
I'm not happy with that decision. <eos> Why not? <eos> Kevin Pamphile should be center lineman.
Haha, yes. Browns, Lions, Teans, and Jaguars. <eos> How do these team stay in business? <eos> It's a local loyalties from the fans.
I sort of have two. <eos> Really, who? <eos> The Steelers and Cowboys.
Not my favorites. <eos> Who's yours? <eos> Miami of course.
Miami of course. <eos> The Dolphins? <eos> Yes.
Cameron Wake is one of my favorite players. <eos> What position is he? <eos> Defensive End.
Yeah, he was into them back in the Marino days. <eos> That was like the ninties, right? <eos> Somewhere around that time.
Somewhere around that time. <eos> How long have you been a Buc fan? <eos> Since i moved down from North Carolina, back in '99.
Only three pre-season games this year. <eos> Who are they playing? <eos> Well, the Dolphins, then the Bears and then the Vikings.
As do I. <eos> Are there any other players you think will continue to flourish? <eos> Gronkowski seems like a good choice, but he is injury prone.
Yes, they make it a big deal. <eos> Like what? <eos> They have face painting food trucks.
32. <eos> What's the team that won the most SuperBowl? <eos> The patriots with 5.
The patriots with 5. <eos> What team did Peyton Manning play for before Denver Broncos? <eos> The Colts.
The Colts. <eos> What's the state with the most NFL team? <eos> Florida with 3.
Florida with 3. <eos> What year did the NFL start to play? <eos> 1920, specifically August 20.
1920, specifically August 20. <eos> When was the first Superbowl? <eos> Haha trick question, January 15, 1967.
Haha trick question, January 15, 1967. <eos> Who won that SuperBowl? <eos> The Packers.
The Packers. <eos> And who lost that game? <eos> The Chiefs, of course.
I would say Joe Montana. <eos> Didn't he play for the San Francisco 49ers? <eos> He did.
He did. <eos> He's won a Superbowl before, right? <eos> While with the 49ers he won four of them.
Yeah, the stadiums are nothing like that. <eos> Plus don't they take about an hour to leave? <eos> Depends, but yeah.
Well you get an average score for the each positions. <eos> Are the QBs highest? <eos> Well, Offensive tackles score the highest.
True, Brandon Marshall is a huge upgrade over Victor Cruz. <eos> Where do you rank Melvin Gordon? <eos> I rank him at 7.
The Steelers have won 6 Super Bowls. <eos> Who's won the most Super Bowls as a team? <eos> It's the Steelers with 6.  The Patriots have 5.
I like the titans. <eos> where are they located? <eos> In tennessee. they are good.
Not quite, but I am ready. <eos> Think Dallas will win the division again this year? <eos> No actually, I'm picking another team.
No actually, I'm picking another team. <eos> You going with the Giants? <eos> Actually no, I'm betting on the Eagles.
Doesn't matter does it? I am going to see my teams. <eos> Ok the bills and patriots I get, but why the dolphins? <eos> You forgot the jets, and because I like them.
No I didn't I just didn't want to mention them. <eos> Josh McCown, how bout that? <eos> Ok, hes a decent player.
You were dreaming again. <eos> Dreaming? And you woke me up? <eos> You were having another nightmare.
You were having another nightmare. <eos> I was? <eos> It was obvious.
It was obvious. <eos> What do you mean? <eos> Well, first you let out a horrific scream...
Well, first you let out a horrific scream... <eos> I screamed again? <eos> Yes. And then you started to perspire terribly.
Yea, he's the greatest ever. <eos> Better than Montana? <eos> I think so.
I think so. <eos> Wonder what Drew Bledsoe thinks? <eos> Haha, old Drew never got his job back.
I can't argue with that. <eos> Maybe because his balls were deflated? <eos> Oh that's just wrong.
I had hoped the team would keep Mallett as a backup. <eos> The guy from Arkansas? <eos> `Yea, I think he had a ton of potential.
Well, they just lost too many games, haha. <eos> Why do you think they lost so much? <eos> The Seahawks' offense just wasn't getting the job done.
The Seahawks' offense just wasn't getting the job done. <eos> Do you think they have improved their offense for this season? <eos> That remains to be seen - hopefully they've made some improvements.
No, not entirely, but he is the easiest to blame, haha. <eos> Did you go to any Seahawks games last year? <eos> No, I prefer to watch the games on TV.
It's a factor, but let's look at some of Jerry's records. <eos> Like which one? <eos> Ok career receiving yards.  Jerry Rice had 22,895 yards.
It's probably cooler to be a Raiders fan. <eos> Why? <eos> I don't know. It just gives off that image to me.
Huh. Well that makes me happy I guess. <eos> Think they stand a chance at winning? <eos> Now that we have Marshawn Lynch, I think it's possible.
Or he overthrows him. <eos> O.K--got any other rule changes? <eos> Well, the illegal contact rule is tricky.
I think Cam Newton needs to knock him off his pedistal. <eos> No one other than Cam has a shot? <eos> Matt Ryan maybe.
Matt Ryan maybe. <eos> What about RG III? <eos> No, he's more hype than hope.
Well I'm not so sure all that happened. <eos> Which one? <eos> Both of them.
I just don't belive someone like Brady would cheat that way. <eos> Well how do you explain how they win so much? <eos> They are just a really solid team.
I didn't like who won,but I liked the game. <eos> Not a patriots fan? <eos> No I'm not.
I'm not either. <eos> Who do you like? <eos> I'm a Giants fan.
Most people say the 1972 Miami Dolphins. <eos> Why? <eos> They went undefeated.
Yes, many of them are in the Hall of Fame. <eos> Are you sure no other team went undefeated? <eos> Three other teams went undefeated during the regular season only.
Well, no the Ravens were originally the Cleveland Browns. <eos> But isn't there a Cleveland Browns team now? <eos> Yes, it's complicated.
Yeah, I'm sure they've built a new one since then. <eos> Who did they beat? <eos> The Cowboys.
Much improved is my guess. <eos> Why in particular? <eos> For one thing, they are developing a very good offensive line.
Hm, I think that's pretty subjective. <eos> What do you mean, why? <eos> Well, some might know more than others.
I think Dante Culpepper is pretty well known. <eos> Who is that? <eos> He was a quaterback for the Minnesota Vikings.
1968. <eos> Who played? <eos> Green Bay Packers against the Oakland Raiders.
14 points. <eos> Who was the announcer? <eos> Ray Scott, with Pat Summerall and Jack Kemp.
Ray Scott, with Pat Summerall and Jack Kemp. <eos> How was the first quarter? <eos> Low scoring.  3-0, Green Bay.
Low scoring.  3-0, Green Bay. <eos> How about the second quarter? <eos> Green Bay scored 13 and Oakland scored 7.
Green Bay scored 13 and Oakland scored 7. <eos> Who played at halftime? <eos> The Grambling State University Band, again.
The Grambling State University Band, again. <eos> By the way, who were the quarterbacks? <eos> Bsrt Starr for Green Bay,  Daryle Lamonica for Oakland.
Eastern Michigan. <eos> How often does the NFL get someone from there? <eos> Every 2-3 years or so, ONE person will be selected.
I don't see anyone in the division overtaking them. <eos> What about the Lions? <eos> Nah, they have no defense.
Nah, they have no defense. <eos> What about the Vikings? <eos> They don't have a good quarterback.
They don't have a good quarterback. <eos> What about the Bears? <eos> Now, you're making me laugh again.
Yea, I think they will go to the Superbowl. <eos> You think they will win? <eos> I don't know, New England is always tough.
It is. <eos> Are they playing the Dolphins? <eos> Yes, in all thier glory.
There are 32 teams at the moment. <eos> So, there's an NFL team in 32 cities? <eos> No, some cities have two teams.
No, some cities have two teams. <eos> Which ones? <eos> New York has two teams.
New York has two teams. <eos> Which two teams? <eos> The New York Giants and the New York Jets.
The New York Giants and the New York Jets. <eos> What other city has two teams? <eos> Los Angeles has two teams as well.
Los Angeles has two teams as well. <eos> What are their names? <eos> It's the Los Angeles Chargers and the Los Angeles Rams.
No, they are moving to Inglewood as soon as possible. <eos> When is that change expected? <eos> Their new stadium is expected to be finished in 2020.
Yes I do, they're very good. <eos> I think they're quarterback is Russell Wilson, right? <eos> Yes, he's short but he makes great plays.
Yes, he's short but he makes great plays. <eos> Who's their best defensive player? <eos> I think it's Richard Sherman, he's an amazing player.
I think it's Richard Sherman, he's an amazing player. <eos> Does he make a lot of interceptions? <eos> Yes he usually gets four or five a year.
He was great, he helped them win a Super Bowl. <eos> How many Super Bowls has the team won? <eos> They won one Super Bowl in 2014.
They won one Super Bowl in 2014. <eos> Who did they beat in that game? <eos> The Denver Broncos, the Seahawks really dominated that game.
The Denver Broncos, the Seahawks really dominated that game. <eos> What's the name of the stadium that they play in? <eos> I think it's CenturyLink Field.
I think it's CenturyLink Field. <eos> Have you ever been to a game there? <eos> No I haven't but my friend has, he loved it.
They were. <eos> Wow, did they get recruited to college teams? <eos> Yes, a lot did.
Yes and no. <eos> Why no? <eos> It's hard to get excited about Tom Savage being QB.
Yeah, I'd be scared as heck. <eos> Plus, Watt coming back this season? <eos> Yeah I'm excited about that.
I bet the Vikings will be pretty good this year. <eos> Even without Adrian Peterson? <eos> Yeah, I think they will be better off without him.
You know? His whole act. <eos> Like not talking to the media? Retiring and coming back? <eos> Yea, that stuff. It all has gotten old.
I'm very impressed by Timber Thomas. <eos> The NFL player? <eos> Absolutely.
Absolutely. <eos> What'd he do? <eos> I just finished watching the Dragons play.
Yes, he had a great season last year too. <eos> Is that when you first noticed him? <eos> Oh yeah.
So far, he's only pulled muscles. <eos> How do you know? <eos> He said it on his twitter.
The New York Giants. <eos> They didn't do so good last season? <eos> No, they didn't make the playoffs.
Yea, he is great but they need a better running back. <eos> Did they pick up one in the off season? <eos> No,not really. I was hoping for that.
No,not really. I was hoping for that. <eos> Eli Manning is quarterback for the Giants. Right? <eos> Yea, but he is coming off a bad season.
Yea, but he is coming off a bad season. <eos> Do you think they might need a new quarterback? <eos> They did pick up a young quarterback.
They did pick up a young quarterback. <eos> Is he going to replace Eli? <eos> No, not enough experience for that yet.
My boy Zeke is going to tear it up this year. <eos> Who's Zeke? <eos> Ezekiel Elliott.
Just saying, probably a bit overrated. <eos> Okay, so what RB would you take over him? <eos> Le'Veon Bell for one.
Yeah, for one, he's a more patient runner. <eos> Okay, but why else? <eos> He's also a better pass catcher.
Not really, it was before my time. <eos> Have you heard of Joe Namath? <eos> Of course.
Yes, they were the heavy favorites. <eos> What year was that? <eos> That was back in 1969, but for the 1968 season.
Mine too. <eos> That's awesome. What did you think of their draft? <eos> I thought it was okay. I thought some picks were weak.
He was a long time ago. <eos> Who is the current quarteback for Miami? <eos> Matt Moore is the current quarterback.
He does. <eos> What did you find? <eos> He's scored the most touchdowns on his team.
He also is the smallest player on his team. <eos> Really? How much does he weigh? <eos> He is 5'9" and weighs 155.
Absolutely. <eos> Does that affect his game? <eos> Well, I know he's faster because he's lean.
That makes sense. <eos> He's a running back right? <eos> Yes, he is.
Mine too. I get more excited every year. <eos> Do you do fantasy football? <eos> No, I have never really got into it.
Keep asking questions to try and guess. <eos> Is it a team in a warm place? <eos> It is a team in a warm climate.
They play in the American Football Conference. <eos> Is their mascot an animal or something else? <eos> Their mascot is an animal.
Ya'll going down hard this season. <eos> Why do you say that? <eos> Tom Brady is going to choke on the field.
That's a deal. <eos> If they win, what should we bet? <eos> $250 if they win.
Yeah, he was there during the 90s. <eos> How many Super Bowls did they win back then? <eos> The won one in 1986 and another in 1990.
You wanna know what. Sure! Why not. <eos> So did you watch the game on sunday? <eos> Yea, the eagles beat minnosota in it bad, 7-42 score.
Me too. <eos> Do you think the Steelers will win? <eos> Maybe, but the Ravens have a strong defense.
Really? I don't like the Patriots at all. <eos> What's your favorite team, then? <eos> I'm a huge fan of the Bears.
Take a guess and I'll tell you if you are right. <eos> Is it the Arizona Cardinals? <eos> No that isn't right.
No that isn't right. <eos> Is it the Los Angeles Chargers? <eos> That isn't right either.
Are you sure just think about it. <eos> Oh wait is it the Baltimore Ravens? <eos> Exactly I just can't stand them.
Exactly I just can't stand them. <eos> Why don't you like them? <eos> There is so much domestic violence associated with their team.
They can choose, as long as they have knowledge. <eos> Knowledge of what? <eos> Consequences.
This reminds me of a movie recently. <eos> Which movie? <eos> Concussion. It stars Will Smith.
Wow, I'd love to do that. <eos> What do you like to eat? <eos> I like burgers and potatoes.
Sounds great. <eos> Who do think will win tonight? <eos> I think that the Eagles are going to win this time.
I quit going to games because of him. <eos> Because of the protest? <eos> Yea! My brother died fighting for that flag.
Yea, the days of glory are long gone. <eos> You mean the Elvis Grbac years? <eos> You are funny, I'm talking about Young and Montana.
Montana is the greatest of all time. <eos> You think he's better than Brady? <eos> I know he is, and young was right up there too.
Oh, my favorite team is the Saints. <eos> The New Orleans Saints? <eos> yeah, the black and gold.
Yep, they blew a huge lead last year to the Patriots. <eos> So do you like the Patriots? <eos> I can't stand Bill Belichek and Tom Brady, so no.
Maybe not this ear but definitely years to come. <eos> Who do you think wins it this year? <eos> The Patriots because there really isn't a better team right now.
I think he's got a few more years left in him. <eos> Who do you think will win it all? <eos> The Cowboys or the Green Bay Packers.
I agree, not too long until NFL training camps start. <eos> What is your favorite NFL team? <eos> I like the Bears, but they have been bad lately.
Well at least Jay Cutler is gone. <eos> Yeah he was bad.  What team do you like? <eos> I like the Dallas Cowboys.
Yeah. I mostly watch NFL football. <eos> Me too! Are you excited for the next season? <eos> Yeah, I am very much am.
I will be rooting for the Houston Texans. <eos> Ohh do you like Clemson? <eos> Yeah and Deshaun Watson is my favorite player.
I know right. He is a good quarterback. <eos> Didn't he play in 3 superbowls? <eos> I believe so, and think the last one was in 2010.
Tom Brady is just a great quarterback. <eos> Will Atlanta want revenge against New England? <eos> They will want to win regardless of who they play.
For all we know it could be two different teams. <eos> How many more years do you think Tom Brady will play? <eos> If it were up to him he would play forever.
If it were up to him he would play forever. <eos> Do you like him? <eos> I think he is a good guy.
Yea, a few seem to be on the decline. <eos> What do you think about Philly? <eos> Uhhh, I'm not sure. I think they have a a quarterback.
Uhhh, I'm not sure. I think they have a a quarterback. <eos> You like Wentz? <eos> Man, that guy is a stud.
Yes, on his shoulder, and he still can't throw. <eos> How long ago was his surgery? <eos> In January so it has been awhile.
They seemed to get more athletic in the draft. <eos> Who did they draft? <eos> Jonathan Allen was number one.
Yes,that's right. <eos> Do you think they can win with Kirk cousins at qb? <eos> He can be good.
Jamison crowder is growing as a target. <eos> He's coming into his third year right? <eos> Yes he is.
I think so. I think I have everything. <eos> Do you have the turkey? <eos> I have the turkey.
Yup. Although I still have't gtten the television fixed. <eos> What? THe television is still broken? <eos> Yeah. Maybe I'll hear from the shop on Friday.
Kirk Cousins is good, he played for Michigan State University. <eos> What is he doing now? <eos> I think he's still the quarterback with the Washington Redskins...
They didn't want to play him much at first. <eos> Why wouldn't they do that? <eos> Apparently, the team thought a lot of other guys were better.
Man I am pumped for this upcoming season. <eos> Me too! who do you like to win it all? <eos> I think the Seahawks will do it.
Yeah I know and the Saints aquired him for cheap too. <eos> How much was his contract for? <eos> It's a 2 year $7 millon dollar deal.
Norv Turner ruined this francise. <eos> Remember the 91 season? <eos> Yea, that was perfect.
I do too. <eos> What do you think the reason is? <eos> I don't know if there is one reason.
I think it's overexposed. <eos> You mean to many games on? <eos> That's exactly what I mean.
I want to go to a Vikings game this season. <eos> Did you win the lottery? <eos> No, but I really want to go.
They have no quarterback. <eos> How about josh mccown? <eos> How about he's a journeyman at best.
How about he's a journeyman at best. <eos> Who else do they have at qb? <eos> Christian hackenberg and Bryce petty.
I actually believe it will be the Seahawks and Panthers. <eos> So, you think the Patriots won by chance last year? <eos> No.The Patriots did not play a great team in the Superbowl.
I hope so! We usually get partial season tickets. <eos> For which team? <eos> The Giants.
Yea, they're definitely better than the Jets. <eos> Are tickets to the Giants and Jets the same price? <eos> Honestly, I never even checked for the Jets.
I thought so too. <eos> What do they have New England doing? <eos> They have them going over 11 wins.
That's a good possibility. <eos> How about the Cowboys? <eos> They have them going over 9.5 wins.
Yes, Miami over Washington. <eos> Where did they play? <eos> Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.
Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. <eos> Who were the coaches? <eos> Don Shula and George Allen.
Don Shula and George Allen. <eos> Who were the quarterbacks? <eos> Bob Griese and Billy Kilmer.
Bob Griese and Billy Kilmer. <eos> Who scored first? <eos> Miami, touchdown pass.
Miami, touchdown pass. <eos> What happened in the second quarter? <eos> Miami scored another touchdown, a one yard run by Kiick.
No scoring. <eos> And in the fourth? <eos> Washington scored a touchdown on a crazy play by Garo Yepremian.
That could be said for any quarterback though. <eos> Like Brady? <eos> Or even Brees and Roethlisberger.
Yeah that's a safe bet. <eos> Any teams you think will be a surprise this season? <eos> Maybe Miami, they may come out of nowhere and do good.
Oh year, Cutler is gone. That's an upgrade just there. <eos> Ha ha. Pick six Cutler. He retired, right? <eos> I believe so.
He plays for the Green Bay Packers. <eos> Oh wasn't he in the news for something recently? <eos> I think he broke up with his girlfriend.
I think he broke up with his girlfriend. <eos> Oh that's right! Who was he dating? <eos> I think it was Olivia Munn.
I think it was Olivia Munn. <eos> I think that's right. How are the Steelers doing? <eos> They did pretty well last season. They went 11-5.
They did pretty well last season. They went 11-5. <eos> Oh that is pretty good! Who are their best players? <eos> Ben Roethlisberger and Antonio Brown are both pretty good.
Ben Roethlisberger and Antonio Brown are both pretty good. <eos> Yeah, I have heard of them. Who is their biggest rival? <eos> People in Ohio are pretty serious about the Browns-Steelers rivalry.
I just saw highlights of Superbowl XXXIX. <eos> The Patriots' third Superbowl championship? <eos> Yes, this time not won by a last minute field goal.
0-0 at the end of the first quarter. <eos> Who scored first? <eos> Philadelphia, but the Pats tied it up.
I heard Paul McCartney was a safe choice. <eos> What happened in the third quarter? <eos> The Pats scored, but the Eagles tied it.
The Pats scored, but the Eagles tied it. <eos> So it was tied going into the fourth quarter? <eos> Yes, 14-14.
Yes, 14-14. <eos> Who scored next? <eos> The Patriots, a touchdown and a Vinateri field goal, 24-14.
Yes, they have an amazingly talented team. <eos> How so? <eos> They plan such interesting plays I've never seen before.
I like their biceps.  They are the biggest I've seen. <eos> DId they win their last game? <eos> Yes, it was so exciting.
Yes, it was so exciting. <eos> Have you seen them live in person? <eos> Yes, I go to the home games a lot.
Yes, I go to the home games a lot. <eos> Do you have season tickets? <eos> No, but I'd like to get some.
No, but I'd like to get some. <eos> They are hard to get, aren't they? <eos> Yes, and expensive.
Yeah, he has a pretty big mouth. <eos> Did you know that he went to Stanford? <eos> Really, I had no idea.
Yeah, it came out when he was in the Super Bowl. <eos> Where's he from originally? <eos> I think Compton, California.
I'm really confused about the NFL and its TV schedule. <eos> How so? <eos> Well, they have one Monday Night matchup and all-day Sunday.
After he got hurt, it was all over. <eos> Who do you think is the greatest? <eos> Marcus Allen, no question.
Really?  That seems high to me. <eos> I don't think so.  Why do you say that? <eos> Well, the rest of the division all got better.
Kansas City for sure. <eos> What about the NFC South? <eos> The Saints will easily win that division.
Well, a big topic is concussions. <eos> I wonder how many football players have had concussions? <eos> I don't know.  Good question.
That's easy Emmitt Smith. <eos> Why do you think it's Emmitt? <eos> He holds all the records.
Emmitt has the all time touchdown record. <eos> How many touchdowns did he have? <eos> Emmitt Smith had 164 rushing touchdowns.
Emmitt Smith had 164 rushing touchdowns. <eos> How many yards did he have? <eos> Emmitt Smith had 18,355 yards rushing.
Emmitt also has a few other records. <eos> Like what? <eos> He has the most carries.
Yeah he was the best running back of all time. <eos> How old was Emmitt when he retired? <eos> Emmitt was 35 years old when he retired.
Yeah it was a Monday night game in the Superdome. <eos> Who did the Saints play? <eos> Only our biggest rival, the dirty birds.
Only our biggest rival, the dirty birds. <eos> The Atalanta Falcons? <eos> Yes haha. We call them the dirty birds.
Yea I heard that too. <eos> Did you know he suffers from drop foot? <eos> No I did not know that.
He has to wear a brace. <eos> Wow, does that affect his playing? <eos> Not really. His contract goes till 2019.
The Cowboys are starting him off as a middle linebacker. <eos> Great! How do they think he will do? <eos> They are starting him off as if he has no injuries.
As long as they have Aaron Rodgers anything is possible. <eos> He's something else isn't he? <eos> That's putting it mildly.
Everyone of them were in a huge game. <eos> How is there schedule this year? <eos> They've got some tough games.
They've got some tough games. <eos> Who do they open with? <eos> They open at home with the Seahawks.
The Colts are my team. <eos> Is 2007 when they won the Super Bowl? <eos> Yeah, we were the champions.
Yeah, we were the champions. <eos> Who did they have on that team? <eos> Peyton Manning was our quarterback.
Peyton Manning was our quarterback. <eos> Didn't they have Bob Sanders? <eos> Yeah Bob was our free safety.
Yeah he was great when he wasn't injured. <eos> Who else did they have? <eos> We had Dwight Freeny as our defense end.
Multiply. <eos> Huh? <eos> Times is not a verb. Multiply is.
Times is not a verb. Multiply is. <eos> Oh shut up. What do you think about the wages? <eos> I think they're completely fair yet unfair.
They are a pretty good team. <eos> Who is your favorite player on their current roster? <eos> I think Matt Forte is good.
I think he is talented. <eos> Who do you think will be starting Quarterback for them? <eos> I think Christian Hackenberg.
Yes, he was another consistant one with good stats. <eos> Same as Lynch? <eos> Similiar. Plus he had other things going on.
I like some of them, but not all of them. <eos> Which ones don't you like? <eos> I don't like how you can't hit a quarterback anymore.
That's a lawsuit they won't win. <eos> Why don't you think the NFL will win? <eos> There has been evidence for years the football causes concussions.
So would the rest of America I am sure. <eos> Do you think this could happen soon? <eos> Yeah around the time the next CBA needs to be agreed.
Yeah until Goodell did everything imaginable to bust that. <eos> Do you have a favorite team? <eos> I do I love the Patriots.
Great. My girl will be happy to have the company. <eos> Doesn't she watch the game? <eos> No, she could not care less about the NFL.
Yea, It's too bad they didn't win last year. <eos> Yea, they really blew that one, didn't they? <eos> Yea, they really had that game, but they sure blew it.
He was always so animated. <eos> They used to be coached by Tony Dungy, right? <eos> Yes, he was a great coach.
Yes, they beat the Chiefs. It wasn't called super bowl, though. <eos> Really? What was it called? <eos> It was just a championship game.
It was just a championship game. <eos> When did it become super bowl? <eos> The next game, played in 1968.
The next game, played in 1968. <eos> Who was in that game? <eos> The Packers and Raiders, and the Packers won again.
The Packers and Raiders, and the Packers won again. <eos> So they won the first two championship games ever? <eos> Yes.
If Derek Carr can bounce back from his injury,yes I do. <eos> He broke his leg right? <eos> Yes,he broke his fibula.
Yes it is. <eos> Didn't they get marshawn lynch? <eos> Yes they did.
That means I won't miss one Miami game all year. <eos> I could also see my team too, right? <eos> I guess so, we could split the screen.
I never heard of him. <eos> Really? Not even with Fantasy Football rosters? <eos> No.
The Giants. <eos> Because of a few years ago? <eos> No man, it's hereditary. I've been a lifelong fan.
Yeah. Interestingly, the Giants wanted it to come down to that. <eos> What do you mean? <eos> They planned to let Thurman Thomas run all over them.
But didn't want to let Jim Kelly complete a pass. <eos> So they had a lot of long downs? <eos> Exactly. Make a lot of 3rd and forevers.
Exactly. Make a lot of 3rd and forevers. <eos> So what, they made Norwood kick? <eos> Yeah, they knew he wasn't a great kicker at distance.
Set by Bill Belichick. <eos> Whaaaaaat? <eos> Yep, he's an evil genius.
Okay. <eos> What team do you like best? <eos> I like the Steelers a lot.
He is pretty great. <eos> Have you seen them yet in person? <eos> I did go to one game.
I did go to one game. <eos> Was it amazing? <eos> Yeah it definitely was.
I definitely agree. <eos> Do you like them more than the Patriots? <eos> For sure.
They are kind of underrated though. <eos> Which team? <eos> The Steelers.
Two if I remember correctly. <eos> Aren't they building a brand new stadium? <eos> Yep, it's going to be off the strip I think.
I'm going to get tickets to that game. <eos> Can I go with you? <eos> Of course.
Yeah, I think it was the Green Bay Packers. <eos> And who else? <eos> The Kansas City Chiefs I believe.
Yeah! i can't wait. <eos> Who is your favorite team? <eos> I like the Saints.
Won't know until he gets a chance to shine, we'll see. <eos> You think anyone is about to have a comeback season? <eos> Cam Newton, he might get the Panthers back this year.
They still talk about Urlacher and he's long retired. <eos> Yeah, I mean he played defense right? <eos> Yes, he was like a defensive back.
Teams don't even put as much weight into the position. <eos> You think Adrian Pederson? <eos> He is good but not sure as he is getting older.
He is good but not sure as he is getting older. <eos> How about Lesean McCoy? <eos> McCoy is shifty but not an all around back.
McCoy is shifty but not an all around back. <eos> How about the new kid Ezekial Elliot? <eos> He looked good last year but still a lot to prove.
He is definitely one of the better backs in the league. <eos> How about DeMarco Murray? <eos> After going to Tennessee he had a resurgence.
It starts the first week of September. <eos> Who do you think will have a good season this year? <eos> I am hoping that the Panthers come out strong this season.
Yes, they have the Chargers and the Rams. <eos> What teams were in the Super Bowl last year? <eos> The New England Patriots and the Atlanta Falcons participated last year.
The New England Patriots and the Atlanta Falcons participated last year. <eos> Which NFL team did Tim Tebow play for? <eos> He played for the Denver Broncos and the New York Jets.

He has participated in seven with the New England Patriots. <eos> How many NFL franchises are there for 2017? <eos> There are currently thirty-two NFL teams.
Yeah he must be proud of what he accomplished. <eos> Do you think Rayne Prescott can replace Romo? <eos> He did a great job last season.
He did a great job last season. <eos> How were his stats? <eos> He got 23 touchdowns with only 4 interceptions.
True, solid team at every position. <eos> Who falls off the most this year? <eos> I think Denver continues to slide.
Rookies. <eos> Why are you rooting against them? <eos> I'm not, really. I'm rooting against the system.
More-so wiser than anything. <eos> Yeah, they've seen it all, right? <eos> Yup. So, the system needs to change.
Well, they lost the division title two years in a row. <eos> Have they ever won a Super Bowl? <eos> They won one, I think.
Yeah that doesn't help your standing. <eos> Is Josh Gordon any good? <eos> He got over 2,500 yards over the course of two seasons.
He is going to Texas. <eos> To the Cowboys? <eos> No, he is going back to the Texans.
Yes, he was an all star in college. <eos> He went to Wisconsin right? <eos> Yes, big change to go to Texas.
Right, at least it is the Texans. <eos> Why do you say that? <eos> Texans have a smaller following.
Texans have a smaller following. <eos> Than who? <eos> Than say, Green Bay, or the Cowboys.
Than say, Green Bay, or the Cowboys. <eos> How is that good? <eos> Small town guy, going to a massive NFL team,lots of drama.
I was close enough to smell the players. <eos> Are you going to any games this year? <eos> No, not enough money.
That should be interesting. <eos> Why is that? <eos> Watkins, thats why.
It stars Will smith and it's about the NFL. <eos> Oh cool. Is Will smith a football player? <eos> No actually he's an African doctor.
I just watched a video on some of the best receivers. <eos> That's cool. Did Julian Edelman make the list? <eos> He did, but I am unsure why.
He did, but I am unsure why. <eos> What do you mean? <eos> Well, I haven't really seen him make too many great catches.
I just saw the highlights of Superbowl V. <eos> Colts against the Cowboys? <eos> Yes, the first Superbowl after the merger.
Right. <eos> Who scored first? <eos> Dallas, field goal in the first quarter.
Dallas, field goal in the first quarter. <eos> Who was leading at the half? <eos> Dallas, 13-6.
Yes! I've been waiting since the Super Bowl in February. <eos> What's the team you follow? <eos> The Dallas Cowboys are my team of choice.
The Dallas Cowboys are my team of choice. <eos> Who are your favorite players? <eos> Ezekiel Elliot and Dak Prescott make a great team.
Ezekiel Elliot and Dak Prescott make a great team. <eos> What school did Elliot come from? <eos> The Ohio State University.
Meh. <eos> What's that supposed to mean? <eos> It means it won't happen.
Yeah, they are very consistent. <eos> Who is your favorite team? <eos> I am a big Bengals fan, actually.
Yeah, it's almost time for training camps. <eos> Do your 49ers still have theirs at Sierra College? <eos> No, they have it in Santa Clara.
Not a good idea to dehydrate your multi-millionaires ha, ha. <eos> Have you been to the new 49er stadium? <eos> Levi's Stadium, no they made it too expensive.
I'd say 1985 chicago bears. <eos> Really? Why the bears? <eos> The team they assembled that year was perfect.
I'd say the 1972 Dolphins. <eos> Why bescause of their perfect record? <eos> Exactly because of their perfect record.
I actually like Denver Broncos for winning this year. <eos> Why do you think they could win versus the Patriots? <eos> They have a well balanced team and a young quarterback.
Man I can't believe you asked me that. <eos> Come on, why you say that? <eos> I feel lke I lost my best friend.
Me too. Followed him since he was with th Panthers. <eos> Yes he did well on that team. Why he leave? <eos> They let him go.
They let him go. <eos> Was it about money? <eos> Man it's always about the money.
It doesn't matter. Manning's 4-0 is still not worth bragging about. <eos> Well, what has Brady done on the field? <eos> What has Brady done? He's done multiple Super Bowls.
Darrell Green. <eos> Is he faster then Randy Moss? <eos> I think so.
Thats what I mean. <eos> Didn't he get in trouble for marijuana? <eos> Yes, but so did michael phelps.
Yes I do. <eos> Who is your favorite team? <eos> The Cleveland Browns.
Yeah pretty much how I feel too. <eos> Do you go to many games? <eos> I have season tickets.
Appreciate it. Thanks man. <eos> No problem. Any other good pregames to look forward to? <eos> August 25th Kansas City Chiefs at Seattle Seahawks should be promising.
August 25th Kansas City Chiefs at Seattle Seahawks should be promising. <eos> Ooo. That will be a good one. What's Denver look like? <eos> They're earlier on. August 10th I think at Chicago Bears.
The Eagles got a good rookie quarterback though. <eos> Yeah but do they have anything else on offense? <eos> I guess we'll find out tomorrow.
I know. Only two wins and fourteen losses. <eos> Who did they beat? <eos> Both times they won against the Rams.
They did get a new one for this year. <eos> Who is it? <eos> His name is Kyle Shanahan.
Hallway football. <eos> Hallway football? <eos> Yup.
Oh, but they are, much more annoying. <eos> In what ways exactly? <eos> For one, all they talk about was their Super Bowl victory.
Some new ones are pretty dope. <eos> Uhhh, like who? <eos> Not sure.
Not sure. <eos> Who do you think has the best offense so far? <eos> Definitely the Patriots.
Definitely the Patriots. <eos> Then the defense? <eos> Broncos, or the Packers.
None there. <eos> And the Browns? <eos> Meh, they're okay.
The Buffalo Bills. <eos> What about them? <eos> 7 and 9 last season, didnt make the playoffs.
7 and 9 last season, didnt make the playoffs. <eos> Yes, but how do they look this season? <eos> Well, they didn't get any good draft pics.
But the best part is the city. <eos> How so? <eos> Green Bay is tiny, especially compared to other football cities.
Green Bay is tiny, especially compared to other football cities. <eos> Isn't it the smallest? <eos> Yup, by far.
Nope, I always admired their fan base. <eos> Big fan of Aaron Rogers? <eos> You know it. Great guy.
I,always thought he was overrated. <eos> Even as a defensive coordinator? <eos> Yes because he had some players with Baltimore.
I can't argue with that. <eos> So will the Bills be better without him? <eos> I think they have to be.
I think they have to be. <eos> You mean addition by subtraction? <eos> That's what I mean.
That's what I mean. <eos> They hired Sean McDermott right? <eos> Yes they did.
I don't have much of an opinion on them. <eos> How about an opinion on Kirk Cousins? <eos> Could have played better this season.
Nope. It was Jerry Rice. <eos> Wow, Rice was considered the greatest player of all time? <eos> Yep, and number two was Walter Payton.
North Carolina. He's really good. <eos> Was he picked in the first round? <eos> Yes. He was the number two overall pick.
They did after the draft. They signed Mike Glennon. <eos> So is Glennon the starter and the draft their back up? <eos> Yes. His name is Trubisky.
Myles Garrett. He went to the Browns. <eos> He's that defensive end from Texas right? <eos> Yeah, Texas A&M.
Soloman Thomas. <eos> I don't remember him. What college is he from? <eos> Stanford.
It's a loss actually, but it's funny. <eos> What is that? <eos> The Thanksgiving coin toss loss game to the Lions.
Could be just the knetic energy fading out from the kick. <eos> You think? <eos> It's a possibility.
Tom Brady isn't that much older than Brees. <eos> How much older is he? <eos> Maybe two years.
They are changing cities. <eos> Again? <eos> Yeah, they are going to Vegas.
Dang.  I wonder why they move so much. <eos> Who knows? <eos> They seem to have a decent fan base .
The Cowboys do have a good team. <eos> Do you know they signed him to a four year contract? <eos> No I did not.
Sounds great to me. <eos> What is your favorite player? <eos> Brian Quick.
Oh he is good. <eos> Yeah. Who is yours? <eos> Robert Quinn.
Agreed, they are great. <eos> I watch every Sunday? <eos> You do? That is more than me.
Yeah I make sure I have the time for it. <eos> Anyways did you see the Super Bowl? <eos> Of course I did.
Of course I did. <eos> What did you think about it? <eos> It was fantastic.
I think the Falcons. <eos> The Atlanta team? <eos> Yes.
Yes. <eos> Why do you say that? <eos> The have good returning players.
Yes, one of their star players was out. <eos> Who? <eos> JJ Watt.
It is the name of the game. <eos> Do you think the Texans have a change this year? <eos> I think they do, they seem to get better every year.
Yes, but that's in the past. <eos> You think this is their year? <eos> Well, not sure about the Superbowl yet.
I know they will. <eos> Do you think they can win the North division? <eos> Without a doubt.
Without a doubt. <eos> What about Green Bay? <eos> They are in decline.
They are in decline. <eos> What about the Lions? <eos> Well, they look good, but they are the Lions.
Yea, the Bears are a joke. <eos> Who is your favorite Viking of all time? <eos> I love Fran Tarkenton.
Yeah but come on the guy is almost 50 years old. <eos> What agre did he retire? <eos> He was forty when he finally hung it up.
That was a great year for the Packers. <eos> How many more years do you think he will play? <eos> That is hard to answer.
Twice, both times with my Auntie. <eos> How did you afford it? <eos> Well this was way back in the 1980s.
He played at Fresno State and was drafted in 2014. <eos> Oh wait, does his brother play in the NFL? <eos> Yeah! His brother, David Carr, used to play for the Giants.
They are certainly better than the New York Jets though. <eos> Oh definitely. What was their record last year? <eos> I think it was 11-5, the same as the Steelers.
Minnesota was favored by twelve points. <eos> Who was the Vikings QB? <eos> The great Joe Kapp.
Yes.  Len Dawson was the KC quarterback. <eos> Who were the coaches? <eos> Bud Grant and Hank Stram.
Bud Grant and Hank Stram. <eos> Who scored first? <eos> KC, with a 48 yard field goal.
The Chiefs, 16-0. <eos> What was the final score? <eos> 23-7, Kansas City.
I am, and I am excited. <eos> What is going good for the Steelers this year? <eos> Well, Martavis Bryant is back for one thing.
Okay cool. <eos> What team is your favorite? <eos> The Seahawks.
The Seahawks. <eos> Oh awesome. What player is your favorite? <eos> Jordan Roos.
I was guessing the same. <eos> You mean you didn't listen? <eos> I got out the car before they mentioned a single name.
Yeah, you're right. <eos> Who else did Ditka coach? <eos> I'm pretty sure it was Chicago you are thinking of.
Yes it does. <eos> Who are you rooting for? <eos> Browns.
The  did really well in the draft. <eos> Did they get some good picks? <eos> Yes, the really strengthened their defense.
It's been over a decade since they were in the playoffs. <eos> Has it been that long? <eos> Yes, but I feel like good things are on the horizon.
I mainly just watch the NFL for the most part. <eos> Do you have a particular team that you cheer for? <eos> Yes, I am a huge Tampa Bay Buccaneers fan.
I am a Denver Broncos fan. <eos> Denver? Really? <eos> Yes. I have been since John Elway was quarterback.
Well, I think the Patriots have the upper hand. <eos> How so? <eos> They have more iconic players and they've done more recently.
I know, it's not the same without it. <eos> Who are you looking to win it all? <eos> I think the Pats will be good again this year.
Yes, that was crazy for sure. Quite a lot of cash. <eos> Something like $150 million right? <eos> Close, he's going to get $125 million for 5 years.
Close, he's going to get $125 million for 5 years. <eos> That's insane, who is he? <eos> It's Derek Carr of the Raiders.
It actually makes him the highest paid NFL player ever. <eos> You're kidding me right now? <eos> No, I'm not, it's the most money per year ever.
No, I'm not, it's the most money per year ever. <eos> So he makes more than Tom Brady? <eos> At the current time yes.
He just might. He keeps pushing this London thing. <eos> Is there anything else you dislike about him? <eos> The fact that he's paid an outrageous amount of money.
That will be the key. <eos> What else do you like about the team? <eos> They have a pretty good offensive line.
Yeah.  But he is getting old. <eos> You don't think he will be a playmaker? <eos> No, probably not.
Joe Namath predicted a victory. <eos> Yes, where was he? <eos> The Miami Touchdown Club.
The Miami Touchdown Club. <eos> How did the scoring go? <eos> The Jets scored a touchdown in the second quarter.
The Jets scored a touchdown in the second quarter. <eos> What was the score at halftime? <eos> 7-0, Jets.
7-0, Jets. <eos> Who was in the halftime show? <eos> The Florida A&M University Band.
Not at all. <eos> Who announced it? <eos> Curt Gowdy.
There is a,good chance of that yes. <eos> How do they get such a tough schedule after going 3-13? <eos> This is the NFL we're talking about.
Yep, that was heart-broken. <eos> Anyway, who do you think is the worst team? <eos> I would have to go the Browns or the Jacs.
My favorite player is Kerrigan. <eos> What position does he play? <eos> Linebacker.  He's really good.
Linebacker.  He's really good. <eos> Isn't he the one that signed a picture for you? <eos> Yes.  It's hanging in my bedroom.
Yes.  It's hanging in my bedroom. <eos> Do you think he'll start this season? <eos> Absolutely.  Unless he gets hurt in training camp.
Junior Galette got hurt last year. <eos> What was his injury? <eos> He had an achilles tendon tear.
He had an achilles tendon tear. <eos> Did he have to sit out? <eos> He was out the whole season.
He's good around the goal line. <eos> Didn't he score eighteen touchdowns last year? <eos> I believe so,yes.
They added a couple of defensive ends too. <eos> Who did they get? <eos> Chris long and Derek Barnett.
I think that is how Tom Brady will go out. <eos> Winning a Super Bowl? <eos> No, playing one season too many and getting some horrific injury.
I think the Packers, Patriots, and Rams will have good years. <eos> You think the Rams will be decent? <eos> Yes, they have a new location and a decent QB now.
I also think the Bengals has a shot. <eos> That sounds iffy, too. Why do you think this? <eos> Their defense has always been stout.
Really why. <eos> Did you see how they played last year? <eos> They were good.
Yeah, Sean McVay has his work cut out for him. <eos> Speaking of California, what do you think of the Raiders? <eos> Awful team. I mean, they haven't had a championship since 1984.
Yes. He died April 3rd of this year. <eos> What was his name again? <eos> Dan Rooney.
Me too, but they probably won't do much without Manning. <eos> I absolutely agree. How long is Manning out? <eos> I think he's coming back for the 5th game.
Yeah, it is. However, Manning doesn't falter at home or away. <eos> Who's starting while Mannings out? <eos> I think they are rotating rookies until his return.
They may have made the dumbest draft pick ever. <eos> You mean the QB they drafted? <eos> Yeah, Mitch Trubisky.
Yeah, Mitch Trubisky. <eos> Why was it a dumb pick? <eos> They traded up for this guy.
Yeah, but that doesn't make him a bad pick. <eos> But why draft him when you had Mike Glennon? <eos> Glennon's not that good.
I just saw Superbowl XXXVI on replay last night. <eos> The first time the Pats one? <eos> Yes, first time.
Yes, first time. <eos> They were in it twice before, right? <eos> Yes, Superbowl XX and XXXI, both losses.
His record is really good. <eos> How many touchdowns has he thrown his whole career? <eos> I am unsure there is a lot.
I am unsure there is a lot. <eos> How many did he make last season? <eos> He had 28 touch downs last season.
I think they will win the AFC for sure. <eos> Who is your dark horse pick? <eos> I'm thinking the Jags.
Of course not.  I despise them. <eos> And why's that? <eos> Because everyone I know seemingly is a Packers fan.
They play in South Philly. <eos> What's the name of their field? <eos> Lincoln Financial.
I can't wait for the season to start. <eos> Who is their biggest rival this year? <eos> I think the Cowboys.
I have a few but Manning is my favorite. <eos> Which one? <eos> Peyton.
Cannot wait to see if he comes back to coach. <eos> really? <eos> I heard rumors but not sure.
They aren't the worst team. <eos> Who is your favorite player on their roster? <eos> Kendall Wright has some promise.
Part of it is luck. <eos> You think he has been unlucky so far? <eos> Yeah exactly what I think.
Ask a silly question, get a silly answer. <eos> Fine, what about gameplay annoys you the most? <eos> Icing the kicker.
Nope, statistics show that the kickers aren't affected. <eos> Don't they panic and re-think the kick and then mess up? <eos> No, they get more time to re-think the angle.
I think they are the trendy pick goign into the season. <eos> Whatever happened with them moving to Las Vegas? <eos> I'm not sure if it got approved.
That is true. The were in Los Angeles at one point. <eos> Who is your pick to win it all? <eos> That's a tough call but I'm going to say the Cowboys.
Man, I used to love the Minnesota Vikings. <eos> You don't anymore? <eos> I still do. But I did more as a kid.
I still do. But I did more as a kid. <eos> What's changed? <eos> Well, I don't live in Minnesota anymore. So there's that.
Yea, we will have the next three games at my house. <eos> Who are we playing against? <eos> The Raiders this week.
The Raiders this week. <eos> Do they still have Derek Carr? <eos> Yea.
Nice. <eos> When are they playing the cowboys? <eos> August 26.
I just hope I can watch the games this year. <eos> You don't watch the games? <eos> Rarely.
Rarely. <eos> Why not? <eos> The stupid blackout policy the commissioner thinks is necessary.
You can't honestly consider Flacco elite. <eos> How on earth is he not an eilte quarterback? <eos> Manning, Brady, and Rodgers, those are the elite three.
Yes, he is good. But, it's because of the weapons. <eos> Weapons? <eos> Yes, the receivers he has in the backfield.
Yes, the receivers he has in the backfield. <eos> You mean Antonio Brown? <eos> Yes, he is amazing.
Yes, Ben has had several of them. <eos> Concussions? <eos> Yes, I think so.
Okay. <eos> What team is your favorite? <eos> I like the Baltimore Ravens the best.
Yeah the team is just the best. <eos> You like it better than the Cowboys? <eos> Well in some ways yes.
I have the worst co-worker at my workplace. <eos> What, are they stealing your stapler? <eos> Even worse, they're a Steelers fan.
I never did either. <eos> Wasn't it Evan engram from Mississippi? <eos> Yes,he's very athletic from what I read.
Right, and they've got Shepard who was awesome last year. <eos> I think they lost Victor Cruz, right? <eos> Yeah, he signed elsewhere, but he's done anyway.
I hope to get to that match-up this year. <eos> When does the season start? <eos> I think the first game is September 10th.
Not really, the NFC isn't looking all that strong this year. <eos> Who do you think is going to win the NFC South? <eos> The Saints, probably, but its going to be a tight one.
The Saints, probably, but its going to be a tight one. <eos> What about the NFC North? <eos> Green Bay has got that division locked up for sure.
Don't count out Detroit though. <eos> Who do you have winning the Super Bowl? <eos> I really like Denver this year.
No Doubt, they are always late playoff contenders. <eos> Who do you have winning the NFC? <eos> I'm sticking with New Orleans, my man.
They are competitive every year. <eos> There was spying, deflate gate, anything else? <eos> There was PEDs gate where they gave several players PEDs.
sometimes but not often. <eos> who do you like? <eos> i like the Seattle Seahawks.
i like the Seattle Seahawks. <eos> why is that? <eos> i like the quarterback.
its Russel Wilson. <eos> why do you like him? <eos> he went to NC State.
he went to NC State. <eos> isnt that your alma mater? <eos> yes! hes awesome.
Oh yeah. <eos> who do you like? <eos> i like the Carolina Panthers.
i like the Carolina Panthers. <eos> why is that? <eos> im from Charlotte.
Yuck. <eos> Why do you say yuck? <eos> Because I am from Wisconsin.
Because I am from Wisconsin. <eos> Oh, so you are a cheese head? <eos> That is right.  Packer fan through and through.
Mike Glennon in Chicago. <eos> So you think Trubisky starts this year? <eos> No I think they tank as well, again.

Yes, they have been good for a long time. <eos> How many Super Bowls have they won? <eos> They have won 4 rings.
Yes, but they also have won 9 championships. <eos> What do you mean? <eos> Well, there were championship games played before the Super Bowl era.
Well, there were championship games played before the Super Bowl era. <eos> I understand. So, in total, they have thirteen? <eos> Yes, that's correct.
Yeah I think thats the truth for the most part. <eos> So why no love for safeties? <eos> There hasnt been a whole lot of great ones.
The Houston Texans were the best last year. <eos> Really?    They were better than the Arizona Cardinals? <eos> The Cardinals were close, but ranked second.
Well, Clowney and Whitney Mercilus did a good job together. <eos> OK, I can see that    Is Watt healthy? <eos> He has been working in the preseason workouts.
I think they will lose a couple games. <eos> Do you think they will win the Super Bowl? <eos> Yeah, I don't think anyone can beat them in the playoffs.
Sure, it's fun. <eos> What is your favorite memoribilia? <eos> I'd have to say my signed Franco Harris football.
My other favorite piece is the signed Joe Namath jersey. <eos> Wow, you're kidding me? <eos> It was very expensive, but I got it.
My favorite memoribilia is my signed Ron Jaworski jersey. <eos> Wow, how did you get that? <eos> I got that at a sporting event years ago.
Yes, Houston and Indianapolis should be better, and even the Jaguars. <eos> Have you ever been to a Titans game? <eos> No I haven't but I want to.
I am going for the Packers this time around. <eos> Really?  Any player in particular? <eos> I am not sure.
I think Tim Tee-bow will do good this year. <eos> Tee-bow really? <eos> Yes.
it's all good. <eos> Really? <eos> Yeah. Wasn't expecting them to win.
Oh Romo wasn't bad, but he ain't a world beater. <eos> Romo wasn't bad? <eos> Hey even Trent Dilfer won a Super Bowl.
Elliott is a beast too. <eos> Where did Prescott go to college? <eos> Somewhere in the SEC i think.
Somewhere in the SEC i think. <eos> Was it Arkansas? <eos> No, I think it was Mississippi St.
I completely agree, coaches are underappreciated. <eos> Hey, do any of your kids watch football with you? <eos> Roy isn't a big fan, he is more into baseball.
Roy isn't a big fan, he is more into baseball. <eos> What about Stephanie? <eos> Suprisingly she is always down to watch the games with me.
Them and the Giants. <eos> Why do you think they kept losing? <eos> Bad luck. Missed kick here, dropped pass there.
Yeah, had some good position players too. <eos> Thurman Thomas? <eos> Yes, he was the running back.
That's true, and we can't forget about the Running Games. <eos> What about the Defensive players? <eos> Yeah, they are very important.
I'm a fan of the Buffalo Bills. <eos> How do you think their new coach will do this year? <eos> I think McDermott will really struggle this year.
Philly. <eos> What do you ;think of Jordan Hicks? <eos> He is a really good player.
I think so too. <eos> Have you ever gone to any of their games?? <eos> Yes, several but many many years ago.
I mean at this point, probably 50. <eos> You think he can hold up that long? <eos> No not at all.
Man, watching the Browns last year was rough. <eos> They were just inept, weren't they? <eos> They just had no talent anywhere on the field.
Absolutely. Lived in Philly for some of my childhood. <eos> Right in Philly? <eos> Well, in the suburbs. Valley Forge.
Yeah, we made the Super Bowl in 2004, but lost. <eos> Who won that year? <eos> The Patriots. One of their first wins. It was horrible.
The Patriots. One of their first wins. It was horrible. <eos> Was it a close game? <eos> Yes, lost by 3.
Exactly, how about Dem' Boys. <eos> Dak and Zeke taking them to the promised land this year? <eos> Yes sir, I believe they will.
Yes sir, I believe they will. <eos> Have you noticed that Jerry Jones has become hands off? <eos> Yes I have, that's why they are finally good again.
Yes I have, that's why they are finally good again. <eos> Garrett is a really good coach isn't he? <eos> Yes he is. The first legit head coach since Parcells.
The Patriots were accused of underinflating balls during a playoff game. <eos> Which one? <eos> The AFC championship game.
The AFC championship game. <eos> What happened? <eos> The Colts alleged the balls were underinflated.

Patriots, 45-7. <eos> Then what? <eos> The NFL had an investigation in 2015.
The NFL had an investigation in 2015. <eos> What was the result? <eos> The NFL concluded the Patriots and Brady were at fault.
Yea, I agree. They probably can't top the Steelers. <eos> Yea, the Steelers are still contenders, aren't they? <eos> They sure are and they have a great time again.
I hope not. <eos> You don't like them? <eos> Not a big fan of cam newton.
If you like, you can come to my house. <eos> Who are coming? <eos> Some friends from work.
His name is Austin Davis. <eos> He used to play for Denver Broncos, right? <eos> Yes, during the 2016 season.
Thanks for that, haha. <eos> How do you think the Lions will do this year? <eos> I am hoping they make it back into the playoffs again.
I love it. <eos> Where do you usually watch the games? <eos> I go to my local bar.
Yeah, the Heidi bowl. Something I'll never forget. <eos> Never heard of it, what was the Heidi bowl? <eos> A game on TV between the Raiders and the Jets.
I think they are a solid team. <eos> Could you expand on your argument? <eos> Drew Brees is all I need to say.
Yeah. It's pretty obvious. <eos> How do you mean? <eos> You look horrible. You haven't showered of shaved all week.
Has always been the Bears but, the Vikings are moving up. <eos> Do you have a favorite player from the Packer past? <eos> Yes, that would have to be Bart Starr for me.
It could be several different teams. <eos> Who do you think has the best chance? <eos> I would have to say the Chiefs.
I would have to say the Chiefs. <eos> Is Alex Smith a reliable Quarterback? <eos> He has something to prove this season.
I am hoping he can. <eos> How are his other stats? <eos> One thing I think he should work on is interceptions.
I loved Superbowl 49. <eos> I bet you did.  You're from Boston, right? <eos> Yes.  A great victory.
Guess who is making a comeback. <eos> Brett Favre? <eos> No, even better. Todd Marinovich.
Not many people have. <eos> When's the last time he played in the NFL? <eos> 1993 for the Raiders.
1993 for the Raiders. <eos> Any how old is he now? <eos> A spry 48.

Yup. <eos> Where? <eos> Orchard Park.  Bills stadium.
Orchard Park.  Bills stadium. <eos> What was that like? <eos> Not as good as you might think.
They have had many short term solutions. <eos> Like Michael Vick, Bobby Hoying, Rodney Peete, Nick Foles, Sam Bradford? <eos> Yes, those are some of the guys in revolving quarterbacks.
The Colts were terrible.  We never won anything. <eos> Didn't you play in a AFC Championship game? <eos> Yeah in 1995 vs the Steelers.
Thanks so much. Gillette Stadium will be rocking that night. <eos> How many touchdowns do you think Brady will throw? <eos> I'm going with four.
He just got knocked out on the field. <eos> When? <eos> It just happened.
It just happened. <eos> Where was I? <eos> In the kitchen.
In the kitchen. <eos> Oh no.  Is he up? <eos> Nope.  Still out cold.
I would have to say supreme. <eos> What does that have on it? <eos> Green peppers, mushrooms, pepperoni, cheese, onions, and sausage.
Not now. <eos> Why not? <eos> Because of the other tradition.
Me too,nothing like football every week. <eos> Dallas and Giants open again right? <eos> Yes they do.
Damien Wilson. <eos> The linebacker? <eos> Yes,the linebacker.
I don't know. <eos> You don't know the quarterback of the team you root for? <eos> Well, I'm not sure they know.
I'm pretty good at knowing things about the NFL. <eos> That's cool. What's your favorite fact? <eos> Well, the Green Bay Packers won the first ever Super Bowl.
Well, the Green Bay Packers won the first ever Super Bowl. <eos> Oh, wow, I didn't know that! What year was that in? <eos> It was in 1967.
I'm pretty partial to the Green Bay Packers. <eos> Nice. Do you think they'll make the playoffs this year? <eos> Definitely. I'm hoping they take the Super Bowl.
I agree. They have good coordination. <eos> Who do you think poses the biggest challenge to them? <eos> Ultimately, Tom Brady has proven to be a pretty scary adversary.
I see, so you're a fairweather fan. <eos> What? <eos> You just like whoever is winning.
1988. <eos> See what I mean? <eos> I guess so. Loyalty can only go so far.
It's crazy. <eos> What do you think their record will be? <eos> Probably 12-4.
I think they'll be in the mix for a playoff spot. <eos> How's there schedule? <eos> They have some tough games.
They have some tough games. <eos> What are the tough ones? <eos> They have the Cowboys and Giants.
Me too. But that's the media for you. <eos> Is gronk going to be healthy for this season? <eos> I think so. I'm not actually sure though.
Actually, I heard he was coming back. <eos> Really? <eos> Yeah. I think the Raiders picked him up.
Same here, I'm a niners fan. <eos> Oh really? <eos> Yeah have been for a long time.
He got picked up by Jaguars. <eos> How much did he get? <eos> 227 mill contract with 18 in signign bonus.
227 mill contract with 18 in signign bonus. <eos> Wait, so he gets paud less than a DE? <eos> Well, the number 1 pick DE, yes.
That was savage. <eos> I wonder if he still holds the record? <eos> Yes, second is Brett Farve.
The big game. <eos> Who's playing? <eos> My favorite team- the Lions.
My favorite team- the Lions. <eos> Cool, are they winning? <eos> Not yet, it's tied.
Not yet, it's tied. <eos> Who is your favorite player? <eos> Ken Stevens, the linebacker.
He's big and strong. <eos> He's been playing for 8 years right? <eos> Yes.
I have a bunch from going to the games. <eos> Who is your favorite player? <eos> I'd have to say now Antonio Brown.
Terry Bradshaw was a great quarterback for them. <eos> He was, what year was he still playing? <eos> Not sure when he started. His last was 1983 though.
Not sure when he started. His last was 1983 though. <eos> Is he in the Hall of Fame? <eos> Yes.
Yes. <eos> They have a few Hall of Famers don't they? <eos> Yes, and don't forget Mean Joe Greene.
I don't know but I'm excited to see. <eos> Do you think this will be Drew Brees' last season? <eos> Yeah. I think it's about time for him to retire.
I know. <eos> How do you think they got so so good? <eos> Hard work and dedication.
Yes, but both he and Ameer Abdullah need to be healthy. <eos> What about the quarterback? <eos> Matthew Stafford is good, but he does too much.
We can hope. We are Philly fans after all. <eos> What do you think the Cowboys will do? <eos> Ah, I think Dak Prescott is due for a regression.
Hmm. I'm no good at these sorts of things. <eos> Why not? <eos> I'm just not knowledgable about football.
I mean, I hope it is less drama. <eos> What do you mean? <eos> Well, there was the whole deflate gate thing.
Well, there was the whole deflate gate thing. <eos> What is that? <eos> A NFL controversy.
A NFL controversy. <eos> What happen? <eos> At the 2015 playoffs, some one supposedly purposely deflated the football.
At the 2015 playoffs, some one supposedly purposely deflated the football. <eos> Who was the guilty party? <eos> New England.
New England. <eos> Was Tom Brady involved? <eos> Yes, that is why I mentioned it.
Yes, that is why I mentioned it. <eos> Did he get in trouble? <eos> He had a four game suspension last year.
I'll throw out O.J. Simpson. <eos> Because of his troubles? <eos> No, I didn't mean discard him--I meant consider him.
Yes, and the rest of the team sucks too. <eos> You think Drew is better than Archie Manning? <eos> Yes, Archie was gritty but never won.
He didn't have much of a supporting cast though. <eos> You think Drew does? <eos> Well, you have a point.
Yes he was. <eos> Think we will win the division? <eos> Well, it's a weak division, so there's a chance.
Sure cant wait. <eos> Do you know what teams have the most Superbowl wins? <eos> I am pretty sure the Pittsburgh Steelers have 6 Superbowl wins.
I am pretty sure the Pittsburgh Steelers have 6 Superbowl wins. <eos> Then whos after them? <eos> The Patriots and the Cowboys each have 5 Superbowl wins.
Nothing but more pain as a Jets fan. <eos> Who's going to be the quarterback this year? <eos> Josh McCown probably, but who knows for sure.
Yea, preseason is my teams only chance. <eos> Wow, who is your team? <eos> I've been a Bears fan forever.
I think that they will have a rough season. <eos> Why do you think that? <eos> Ever since Harbaugh left, they have been in shambles.
Ever since Harbaugh left, they have been in shambles. <eos> What do you think about their recently retired players?? <eos> A shame, but I can understand why it happened.
Hopefully NFL head gear and awareness will keep increasing. <eos> So who are your picks for the super bowl? <eos> I think Seattle and New England will be there again.
I think Andy Reid will do some good things this year. <eos> Super Bowl good? <eos> No, not at all haha.
Up in Minneapolis. <eos> Oh, at the new stadium? <eos> Yeah, it's called the U.S. Bank Stadium.
Ugg,it is almost fall. <eos> Yea so? <eos> Football Season..
Absolutely not. It is a big waste of my time. <eos> So what do you do then? <eos> Anything but watch football.
Anything but watch football. <eos> Do his friends come over? <eos> Sometimes and then I get stuck cooking.
Yeah he's good. They should have a better team this year. <eos> Do you think they will make the playoffs? <eos> Yes. The broncos and Chiefs won't be as good.
Yes. The broncos and Chiefs won't be as good. <eos> Do you like the Chargers new coach? <eos> Yes, they needed a good change.
Yes, they needed a good change. <eos> how many games do you think the Chargers will win? <eos> At least 10.
At least 10. <eos> Do you think they have a chance at the Super Bowl? <eos> Yes, if they can avoid injuries.
I like the Giants this year. <eos> Going all the way to the Super Bowl? <eos> Oh no, maybe Dallas, then.
I guess that's true. <eos> Who else made moves this off-season? <eos> The Raiders are literally moving in a couple of years.
Yes they are all televised. <eos> Do all NFL teams get all their games televised? <eos> I don't think so.
I think they look good to win their division. <eos> Do you see a possible Super Bowl run? <eos> Possible, but I wouldn't bet on it.
Possible, but I wouldn't bet on it. <eos> Why not? <eos> They have too many holes in their defense.
He knew how to market himself. <eos> What kind of record do you see them having? <eos> Well, I'm thinking 10-6.
Well, I'm thinking 10-6. <eos> Wow, that's all? <eos> There are some improved teams in their division.
Okay. <eos> What is your favorite team? <eos> The Patriots.
Interesting choice. <eos> Yeah surprised I did not say Brady? <eos> Yeah.
Yeah. <eos> He is my second favorite, how about that? <eos> Okay that is better.
Okay that is better. <eos> Have you been to the Super Bowl? <eos> Yes I have been a few times.
That change happened in 1922. <eos> Are any of those teams still around? <eos> Yes, there are two of the founding teams still in existence.
Yes, there are two of the founding teams still in existence. <eos> Which two? <eos> Only the Chicago Bears and the Arizona Cardinals remain.
Only the Chicago Bears and the Arizona Cardinals remain. <eos> They had a team in Arizona in 1922? <eos> No, actually, both those teams started in Chicago.
No, actually, both those teams started in Chicago. <eos> What were their names in 1922? <eos> The Chicago Bears were called the Decatur Staleys.
The Chicago Bears were called the Decatur Staleys. <eos> And, the Cardinals? <eos> They were called the Chicago Cardinals.
Pretty cool. I've never been much a fan of football. <eos> Why not? <eos> Well I just think other sports are more interesting.
Well I just think other sports are more interesting. <eos> What's uninteresting about football? <eos> It just feels slow, and less skill.
I'd be beyond literal in the play calling. <eos> How so? <eos> Imagine John Madden.
Come on. John Madden but insanely literal. <eos> Example? <eos> Ask me a question you hear a lot.
They are good. <eos> Who else do you think? <eos> I think the Atlanta Falcons may go all the way.
I think the Atlanta Falcons may go all the way. <eos> What about the Cowboys? <eos> They had an awesome team last year.
They are one of the best teams for sure. <eos> You think Russell Wilson is a great Quarterback? <eos> He isn't a bad quarterback.
They got three games pre-season to get warmed up. <eos> Who do they have to play? <eos> The Dolphins first. They were 10 and 6 last season.
Yea they are good. <eos> Do  you have a favorite team? <eos> Yea, the Eagles.
Wow that is harsh. <eos> Do you think they will ever make it to the Superbowl? <eos> I am hoping they make it this year.
I doubt that. <eos> Why? <eos> They stink.
Better than the Eagles though. <eos> What is your favorite part of the superbowl? <eos> Half time, the music.
Yeah, Bengals and Browns are awful. <eos> How about the Bears? <eos> I don't see the Bears doing better this year.
Sad to see how much they've struggled. <eos> How about the best team out West? <eos> Seattle or maybe the Raiders.
Easy, the Cowboys and maybe the best team overall. <eos> How about the South? <eos> Probably still the Falcons.
Uh, I can't handle the Falcons. <eos> Maybe we should talk about something besides football? <eos> Nah, we can keep it civil.
Yes, they did but Tom Brady is a great player. <eos> I don't know. You don't think he is over rated? <eos> Maybe a little, but for his age he is fantastic.
I heard he does something with oxygen. <eos> Maybe a hyperbaric chamber? <eos> I don't know, It is something.
Yea, I think Pittsburgh should be able to challenge them. <eos> Are you factoring Bell into that? <eos> Yea, I am, but you never know with that guy.
OK with me. <eos> Same side bet? <eos> I'm good for it.
Rodgers is the best and you know it. <eos> Wanna up the bet? <eos> OK double.
I know! I can't wait. <eos> Who is your favorite team? <eos> I like the Green Bay Packers.
Really?  My favorite team is the Dallas Cowboys. <eos> How long have you liked them? <eos> I started following them when Roger Staubach was the quarterback.
I think there are 32. <eos> Is that more than when we were kids? <eos> Yes, they added some teams since then.
Yes, they added some teams since then. <eos> What teams were added? <eos> They now have the Ravens, Jaguars, and Carolina Panthers.
Me too.  I love that color blue. <eos> What other merchandise do you like to purchase? <eos> Believe it or night, I like the sneakers with logos.
I am excited for it though. <eos> When does the actual season start? <eos> I think it kicks off on September 7th.
I think it kicks off on September 7th. <eos> Who plays in that game? <eos> I think it is the Chiefs versus the Patriots.
I think it is the Chiefs versus the Patriots. <eos> Who will you be going for in that game? <eos> I will for sure be pulling for the Chiefs.
You know what, I'm not sure. <eos> You don't watch those networks at night? <eos> Nope, at least not on Sunday.
I just saw Superbowl XXXVIII on replay. <eos> The second Patriots' Superbowl victory? <eos> Yes, a good one.
I was surprised the score was 0-0 after the first quarter. <eos> What was the score at the half? <eos> 14-10, Patriots.
The fourth was a riot of scoring. <eos> How many points were scored? <eos> 37.
Honestly, I think they'll be better than last year. <eos> Oh yeah? Why? <eos> They've still got the best O-Line in the game.
I know. I am sick and tired of watching baseball. <eos> Who is your pick for this year? <eos> I am going for the Pittsburgh Steelers again.
Nope. He is still a Packer. <eos> Is Clay Matthews still on the Packers line up? <eos> Yes. Of course he is. He is easily their best linebacker.
Yes. Of course he is. He is easily their best linebacker. <eos> Even after all this Packer talk your still a Steelers man? <eos> I will always be a Pittsburgh man.
Can't wait for the NFL season. <eos> How do you think the Lions will do? <eos> Same old Lions. All hype.
Geez, fine Michael Strathain. <eos> Is he a legend? <eos> Probably not, i'll retract that.
Its a passing league now. <eos> But who could get that many receptions? <eos> Odell Beckham could.
Oh yeah. Can't wait to see my team in action. <eos> What team is that? <eos> The Bills.
I know, preseason starts in about a month. <eos> Are you excited? <eos> Sort of. My team won't be that good this year.
Yeah, so did Nick Mangold and Darelle Revis. <eos> Wow, that's terrible. Where did Decker go to? <eos> Decker went to the Titains.
I am somewhat of a fan. <eos> Do you think they have a chance to win this year? <eos> They will win games definitely.
I am not sure if they can win a superbowl. <eos> Do you like Sam Bradford? <eos> He put up some great stats for the Vikings this season.
He didn't play nearly as great for the Eagles. <eos> How were his stats with them? <eos> He had one less touchdown with nine more interceptions.
Their total rushing yards are pretty low as a team. <eos> Their statistics aren't that great, are they? <eos> Not really, but I guess they could be worse.
Really, thats a rare one. <eos> What do you mean? <eos> I don't know many people who like them.
I would personally look out for San Francisco this year. <eos> You would? Is that a joke? <eos> Yea, it is. They are going no where.
Yeah, that was the reason. Hopefully that doesn't happen again. <eos> Right. Who you going for this year? <eos> I have to stick with Tampa Bay Buccaneers.
I have to stick with Tampa Bay Buccaneers. <eos> Do you really think they have a chance for the superbowl? <eos> Nothing is impossible, they just signed Sean Renfree as their quarterback.
Yeah, but they say he's pretty good. <eos> Is Savage still on the team? <eos> I think so. He'll probably be backup quarterback.
Yeah, me neither. <eos> When do the real games start? <eos> The first Thursday after Labor day.
The first Thursday after Labor day. <eos> When is the Texan's first real game? <eos> The first Sunday after Labor Day, against the Jaguars.
They'res a lot of so called experts. <eos> What are they saying? <eos> They think the steelers,patriots and packers are the top teams.
I'm not sure about that. <eos> What about the patriots or falcons? <eos> Or how about the Giants or chiefs.
I bet they don't win 5 games this year. <eos> Even with two against the Jets? <eos> I don't see much success from this team.
I hope you are right and I am wrong. <eos> I wonder what Don Shula would think? <eos> He'd make this a better team in a hurry.
I'd take TB12 first, personally. <eos> Do you think the Patriots will repeat this year? <eos> Definitely!  Brady is the greatest of all time.
I sure do hope so. He is my favorite running back. <eos> You like him more than Adrian Peterson? <eos> Yes, I do. I like and respect Adrian Peterson though.
Absolutely. <eos> How often do you go? <eos> Every game that I go to we always tailgate.
Every game that I go to we always tailgate. <eos> Do a lot of people? <eos> Yeah. It's usually a good crowd.
Yeah. It's usually a good crowd. <eos> Do you get rowdy? <eos> Nah, just enjoy ourselves enough to not get in trouble.
Nah, just enjoy ourselves enough to not get in trouble. <eos> What do you eat? <eos> We pack some good grilling things and drinks.
Yeah, he's pretty great. <eos> Who are the Redskins' biggest rivals? <eos> I would say the Cowboys, Eagles and Giants.
Yeah, I don't want to talk about that. <eos> How are they looking this year? <eos> Same as last year.
And you can't forget about Kelvin Benjamin. <eos> Actually, I did haha, how did I forget him? <eos> Who knows, but I think he'll finish top 10 this year.
Alex Smith is decent, but he's not a game changer. <eos> What about the Ravens? <eos> Forgot about them, they have a decent defense and love Flacco.
They whip out old ones once in awhile. <eos> Do you know who they open against? <eos> I don't know yet.
Fitzpartick went to Harvard. <eos> Whoa, what? <eos> yep. he was a math major at Harvard.
Not many. <eos> How many though>Are they any good? <eos> Fitzpartick is pretty good. I mean he's not the worst.
He plays for the Indians now. <eos> He does? <eos> Yes, he was switched last month.
I think it will. <eos> How's it going so far? <eos> He's doing well.
He's doing well. <eos> Is he adjusted? <eos> I think so.
Me either, the guy just wins. <eos> How many superbowls does he have? <eos> I really don't even know. I lost count.
Dak Prescott from the Dallas Cowboys. <eos> What position does he play? <eos> He's a quarterback for the Cowboys.
Me too. I like to feel invested in the games. <eos> Do you think the broncos will be any good this year? <eos> It hasn't been as much fun since manning retired.
He was the president of the original league. <eos> What was that league called? <eos> It was called the American Professional Football Association -- the APFA.
It was called the American Professional Football Association -- the APFA. <eos> When did that happen? <eos> It happened in 1920.
It happened in 1920. <eos> What was the goal of the league? <eos> It was to improve football in all ways.
It was to improve football in all ways. <eos> When did it become the NFL? <eos> They changed the name in 1922.
They changed the name in 1922. <eos> What are some interesting stories from the early days? <eos> In 1932, the championship was played indoors.
In 1932, the championship was played indoors. <eos> No way! Where was it at? <eos> It was at Chicago Stadium.
It was at Chicago Stadium. <eos> Isn't that where Michael Jordan played? <eos> Yes, the Bull won a championship there.
I think so. The score was also strange. <eos> What was it? <eos> The Chicago Bears beat the Portsmouth Spartans 9 to 0.
I guess I would start my list off with Arron Rodgers. <eos> Are you going in order by the way? <eos> No, I am not naming them in any particular order.
That is exciting, it is about time football start back up. <eos> Who is your team? <eos> I like the Kansas City Chiefs.
I like the Kansas City Chiefs. <eos> They have been doing better the last few years, no? <eos> They have. It has been fun to be a fan.
Well, hopefully they do better this year. <eos> Who is your time? <eos> I like the Green Bay Packers.
I used to, not anymore. <eos> Oh, that's too bad, why not? <eos> Too much drama.
Too much drama. <eos> What do you mean? <eos> I mean all the steroids and cheating and stuff.
Yea, you should give it another chance, it's not going anywhere. <eos> Maybe you're right. Who's your favorite team? <eos> I like the Patriots.
It was San Diego Chargers. <eos> What do you mean it was? <eos> Oh, because they are moving to LA.
Apparently, no one, we are very sad. <eos> So will you still root for them? <eos> No, I changed teams, now I am a fan of Raiders.
Oh well!. We´ll Im rooting for Denver Broncos. <eos> Oh really? Who is their coach right now? <eos> It´s Vance Joseph.
Yes I believe it was Matt Ryan. <eos> You are so right. What team did he played for? <eos> Oh that´s easy, he played for the Falcons.
I hate to say it but Dallas. <eos> Are you betting on Prescott having a huge year again? <eos> Yeah I think he will, theres no pressure for him.
I think they win the division this year. <eos> Even over Dallas? <eos> I think Dallas was a fluke last year.
I think he's the best in Giant's history too. <eos> Who are some of your favorite players from the past? <eos> I like Phil Simms.
I like Phil Simms. <eos> What about Harry Carson? <eos> He was good, but you know who the man then was.
They usually have some good divisional games likes Dalls versus Washington. <eos> Do you like the Cowboys? <eos> I do now.  Their team is fun to watch.
Yes, he got dropped. <eos> From the Patriots? <eos> Yes.
Yes. <eos> Did something happen? <eos> Yes, he got injured really bad.
Yes, he got injured really bad. <eos> On the field or practice? <eos> During the pregame season.
I know it was. <eos> What's his new team prospect? <eos> Nothing yet.
They finally got another decent corner too. <eos> Really who? <eos> Stephen Gilmore.
Yeah, he was a great linebacker. <eos> Why did he retire? Wasn't he injured or something? <eos> He retired in January because he had a spinal condition.
I doubt it. <eos> Is he that out of shape? <eos> I'm sure he is.
Gayle Sayers. <eos> Why? <eos> His peers reported that he was the most difficult to tackle.
Yes, but he did that through agility. <eos> Is there another way? <eos> Yes, you can do it through strength.
He's impossible to bring down. <eos> Why? <eos> He just refuses to go down. He drags people with him.
He's scary. And, the great thing is that he's back. <eos> What do you mean? <eos> He just came out of retirement to play for the Raiders.
I remember, Then there is David Fales. <eos> He's new, right? <eos> I think so.
Brandon Dourghty is trying to make a play for third string. <eos> Is he any good? <eos> I don't know, i never heard of him.
He doesn't cheat. <eos> Deflategate anyone? <eos> They didn't prove it.
Then they get the chiefs. <eos> Don't they play New England too? <eos> Yes,in week 15.
Nope. They're like the Giants, but worse. <eos> What about the 49ers? <eos> Ehhh, they might. But they had their good runs.
I think the Falcons have a good chance. <eos> What about the Patriots? <eos> I think they also have a great chance.
Sean McDermott, I think he will do a good job. <eos> Where did Sean McDermott last coach? <eos> He coached the defense for the Carolina Panthers.
Absolutely not. <eos> I'm leaning that way, but not as strongly. Why? <eos> NFL teams are a massive burden on the cities.
That is true, but the NCAA is not the NFL. <eos> Don't they have another quarterback too? <eos> Yes, Brandon Weedon is still on the roster.
Yes, Brandon Weedon is still on the roster. <eos> What team did he come from? <eos> Well, the last team he was with was the Dallas Cowboys.
No, I believe the Cleveland Browns originally drafted Weedon. <eos> Well, that's three, guys.    Will talent win out? <eos> Watson is definitely the most talented, but sometimes it takes time.
Anyone can score if they are wide open. <eos> And how do you think he gets that wide open? <eos> Because defenses are keying on Beasley and Witten all the time.
I do. I love it. <eos> Have you ever been to a game before? <eos> I have only been to one.
I have only been to one. <eos> Who was playing? <eos> It was the Colts versus the Texans in Indianapolis.
It was the Colts versus the Texans in Indianapolis. <eos> Nice. Who ended up winning? <eos> The Texans won. The crowd was pretty upset.
That's for sure. <eos> Do you think Tom Brady will ever slow down? <eos> He's showing no signs of it.
He says he wants to play ten more years. <eos> Won't he be around fifty? <eos> He will be fifty I believe.
I would have to say football would probably be my choice. <eos> Do you like the NFL or college football the best? <eos> I love them both, but I would pick the NFL.
No, no way, never. <eos> Why not? <eos> Biology.
Biology. <eos> Not sexism? <eos> No, basic biology.
Yes, we use to go all the time. Box Seats too. <eos> That's wild. What was it like? <eos> Well, it was kinda underwhelmining.
Yeah, when I was younger. <eos> Do people still do that today? <eos> Sure.
I know. <eos> What card do you think was worth the most? <eos> I think Joe Namath would be worth a lot.
I loved him. <eos> Who's your favorite player today? <eos> I love Roethlisberger.
They won one game. <eos> Oh no! Who did they beat? <eos> The San Diego Chargers.
Yeah, well in 2015 they were 3-13. <eos> I see. Who is their head coach? <eos> They had a new head coach last year, Hue Jackson.
He was previously the offensive coordinator for the Bengals. <eos> Oh, where are the Bengals from? <eos> They are Ohio's other team, they are from Cincinnati.
I saw a replay of the first Superbowl last night. <eos> Wasn't it not called the Superbowl? <eos> Right, it was called a World Championship game.
Right, it was called a World Championship game. <eos> Who played? <eos> The Kansas City Chiefs versus the Green Bay Packers.
NBC had the AFL rights and CBS had the NFL rights. <eos> Who scored first? <eos> Green Bay, 7-0, first quarter.
Here's a hint: it's in the NFC. <eos> The Cowboys? <eos> No, that's too trendy.  I was thinking of the Bucs.
Sure, but he's got some talent. <eos> What do you think of their running back situation? <eos> I love Doug Martin, if he can stay healthy.
And rich. <eos> Was that under Tom Landrey? <eos> Not sure, great coach though.
Every time he goes for the ball, he slips. <eos> What's his problem? <eos> He has legal issues at home.
He has legal issues at home. <eos> And? <eos> They say it's affecting his game.
He's gotta shape up soon. <eos> Do you think he will? <eos> Maybe if he solves his legal woes.
I'm trying to avoid that notion. <eos> Why? <eos> He used to be on my top list.
It was. <eos> Is Siemian the quarterback now? <eos> He is.  I don't know how good he will be.
They will have a good group of receivers this season. <eos> Did they draft any receivers? <eos> They drafted OJ Howard from Alabama.
Yeah, Dallas. <eos> Oh, who wasn't? <eos> Yeah, it seemed like everyone was a fan.
He's a sports anchor now. <eos> Oh, on what channel? <eos> I think it's on Fox.
It was the Colts. <eos> Oh yeah. They ended up losing still didn't they? <eos> Yeah, unfortunately.
I think Marshawn Lynch will have a resurgence. <eos> What makes you say that? <eos> New team and new scenery.
New team and new scenery. <eos> But he is getting pretty old, right? <eos> Yes, but he has somewhat low mileage considering.
That is debatable, but I think I see your point. <eos> Who do you believe will have a great season? <eos> Watch out for Eddy Lacy this year.
Sir, I am a huge Vikings fan. <eos> The Vikings? Of Minnesota? <eos> The very same.
The market dictates that nowadays. <eos> So you think he couldnt have gotten a better deal anywhere? <eos> No I think it would have been too tough.
You're forgetting one little guy I think though. <eos> Who am I forgetting? <eos> Some guy named JJ Watt.
I just saw Superbowl XVII. <eos> Who played in that one? <eos> Miami versus the Washington Redskins.

They dont want the headache I guess. <eos> But what has Savage ever done that shows hes competent? <eos> He looked better than Osweiler in the playoff game.
I admit that you are right. <eos> So does Watson come in by game 2? <eos> I think Bill O Brien will slowly bring him along.
I think Bill O Brien will slowly bring him along. <eos> You think hes worth the first rounder? <eos> No because of the spread offense he played in.
I really, really like Marshawn Lynch. <eos> Me too, what is it that you like about him? <eos> Mostly I like his attitude and ability on the football field.
I agree. I am ready for the season to start. <eos> Wouldn't it be cool to have a Superbowl ring? <eos> I think I saw one sold on Pawn Stars.

I really feel that they will get there this time around. <eos> Any other story lines that have your attention? <eos> I am very interested in Cam Newton Actually.
Well, this team has parted with 3 of their players. <eos> Which ones did they let go? <eos> I believe it was Andy Mulumba, Anthony Kukwa, and Neiron Ball.
That's probably because he didn't know the playbook well. <eos> Didn't Aaron Rodgers say something about him not being ready? <eos> I'm not sure, but I read that the coach mentioned it.
I just saw highlights from Superbowl XX. <eos> Who played in that one? <eos> The New England Patriots against the Chicago Bears.

Yes, and he also played for the Barcelona Dragons. <eos> Who else? <eos> David Akers, the former kicker for the Eagles.

They cut 3 players at once. <eos> Really? <eos> Yeah.  They are bringing in new players soon.

Yes it is. <eos> Usually, it's one by one right? <eos> Yeah, but coach said they needed big change.
Yeah, but coach said they needed big change. <eos> Any major players? <eos> You might know Brock Berrens.
And they got him in 2000. No doubt. <eos> Who else did they get in 2000? <eos> They selected Chris McIntosh as well as Darrell Jackson.
Oh you know is Peyton Manning. <eos> Peyton, why him? <eos> He plays football like a CEO of a company.
That is typical of the Browns. <eos> Are you going to any games this season? <eos> I might go to one or two games.
I think play kickers are failry ignored. <eos> Yeah they are I can confirm it. How old is he? <eos> He is 44 years old now.
Congratulations on the Super Bowl victory. <eos> Thank you! What team do you like? <eos> I like the Jags.
I like the Jags. <eos> The Jacksonville Jaguars? <eos> Yes, the Jacksonville Jaguars.
Yes, the Jacksonville Jaguars. <eos> Do they still have Gabbart as their quarterback? <eos> Yes, l think so.
Yes, l think so. <eos> What happened to Maurice Jones-Drew? <eos> He went away in free agency.
They must have at one point. <eos> Wasn't the coach of the Jags with Seattle at one point? <eos> Gus Bradley? Yes, he was.
Well, with no doubt it is Bill Cower. <eos> Why is he your fav? <eos> Watching him on the sidelines was great.
Well, my favority was Rex Ryan. <eos> Rex Ryan? <eos> Yes, when he was fat.
Yes, when he was fat. <eos> Haha, why when he was fat? <eos> He was more jolly then.
He was more jolly then. <eos> Jolly? <eos> Yes, like he was having more fun.
He got way more serious when he lost all his weight. <eos> Like Samson when he lost his hair? <eos> Exactally! It was just a total 180.
Oh snap. <eos> Who you going for? <eos> The Alphas.
True, but unlikely. <eos> Why is that? <eos> Kemp Taylor is out on injury.
I always am. <eos> Who do you think breaks out this year as a quarterback? <eos> Marcus Mariota is my pick.
Maybe he will be a lucky charm for the Cardinals. <eos> You know who can use a lucky charm? <eos> Who? I'm sure there are several...
It's okay. <eos> What is your favorite team? <eos> New Orleans Saints.
There were people cheering at the tv and excited about it. <eos> Have you ever lived in a city that had a team? <eos> No.
What? No way, you're crazy. <eos> Who is better than Tom Brady? <eos> Tom is greay, but Peyton Manning crushes him.
What are you talking about? Favre has like 72,000 yards completed. <eos> How many does Tom Brady have? <eos> Maybe 60,000.
It's a huge difference. <eos> What about Eli Manning? <eos> Tom is better than Eli.
Oh for sure dude! We're gonna be great this year. <eos> I know - don't you think Russell Wilson is just amazing? <eos> For sure man. Don't forget Richard Sherman.
Cardinals. Our main players are kind of getting old. <eos> Yeah, is Palmer still playing? <eos> He is. He's okay but he always chokes though...
He was the best in the 1990s. <eos> What about Marshall Faulk? <eos> He was great, but maybe not the greatest.
To be the greatest ever, yes. <eos> So Brady eclipsed him by 2004? <eos> It looks like that now.
Yeah, he was just on another level. <eos> Who are you exited to see play? <eos> I am very interested in Mitch Trubiski.
I can agree with that. <eos> So are you going to go to any games next season? <eos> I might, I'll let you know so we can go together.
I'd have to say Odell Beckham. <eos> What team is he on? <eos> He's a young receiver for the Giants.
Mine as well. <eos> Who do you like? <eos> I like the colts how about you.
I think they will to but I hope someone else wins. <eos> Really? <eos> Yeah someone else deserves to win.
He's alright. <eos> Who would win in a race? <eos> I'd say Crunks.
Can't wait for it to begin. <eos> What team are you going for this year? <eos> The Giants.
It gets better the following week. <eos> Don't the Giants play? <eos> Yes at home against the lions.
The following week the Cowboys go to Arizona. <eos> Do you think the Cowboys will win the NFC east again? <eos> I don't think so,no.
That's the only time the Giants will be on Monday night. <eos> Only one time? <eos> Yes,only one time for the Cowboys too.
What? Dude, you're crazy. <eos> I don't know. You think Cam's still got it? <eos> Dang, man. He's what, 28? Of course he's still got it.
You might wanna recoup your bet. <eos> Really? <eos> Not looking good for you.
Roy Williams was good in 2002. <eos> Remember Walter Payton? <eos> Then Bill Parcells was coach.
Then Bill Parcells was coach. <eos> Who was quarter back in 2005? <eos> I think it was Drew Bledsoe.
I think it was Drew Bledsoe. <eos> Remember Terrell Owens? <eos> He got happy when he got a touch down.
I was rooting against the Patriots. <eos> Why is that? <eos> I war mostly rooting against Tom Brady.
I war mostly rooting against Tom Brady. <eos> Because of the whole deflate gate? <eos> No.
No. <eos> Another reason? <eos> I just don't care for his personality.

I think he will stay healthy this year. <eos> Why do you think that? <eos> I believe the Patriots will use him more sparingly.
He would have been dominant with Brady. <eos> Yes, this is true. Do you like Tony Gonzalez? <eos> He might be the greatest receiving tight end ever.

Jarvis Landry has also been having trouble with the transition. <eos> OK, so what direction does the offense move in? <eos> I see a reliance on the play-action pass.
Steady, but it might well be the best chance for success. <eos> Will the Dolphins be a playoff team? <eos> Outlook cloudy, but a definite possibility.
True, but I think modern athletes would out perform him easily. <eos> Who do you have in mind, then? <eos> Bo Jackson is often mentioned.
Danny Ainge played baseball and basketball professionaly. <eos> Wow, I didn't know that. Any others? <eos> George Halas played pro baseball and pro football.
Okay, thanks. The next most famous player would be Desmond Howard. <eos> The Heisman trophy winner? <eos> Yes, he's famous for striking the Heisman pose.

A touch over 800 yards, so not great. <eos> OK, who else? <eos> They also have Bilal Powell. with 700 yards last season.
Well, the Jets have a new offensive coordinator. <eos> Will that help? <eos> John Morton is going to want to increase the tempo.

TE.  I don't know what to do. <eos> How could you not go with Gronk? <eos> Don't get me wrong, I want to choose him.
Travis Kelce had a sneaky good year last year. <eos> For the Chiefs, right? <eos> Yep, he was a favorite target there.
I thought the Super Bowl was not a necessary criterion. <eos> O.K, but seven? <eos> He lost two.
Yeah, i think that's a good call. <eos> Where is the Hall of Fame located? <eos> Oh, in Canton i believe.
Oh, in Canton i believe. <eos> Ohio? <eos> Yes, in Ohio.
Yes, in Ohio. <eos> Have you ever been there? <eos> No, i've always wanted to go tho.

I don't know any of them. <eos> Have you heard of Leonard Fournette? <eos> Yes I have.
He played for LSU. <eos> Is he a running back? <eos> Yup.  A very good one.
Yup.  A very good one. <eos> Who will he be playing for? <eos> He is with the Jacksonville Jaguars.
That is one way to go about it. <eos> Are there any other good rookies this year? <eos> Dalvin Cook should be pretty good to.
That is a tough question. Wild guess..Green Bay & Pittsburg. <eos> Who would you want to see win with that matchup? <eos> The Green & Gold Packers. My favorite team.
Vince Lombardi. Broke my heart when he left Green Bay. <eos> What is your opinion of Aaron Rodgers? <eos> I think he is the best quarterback in football hands down.
The first game is September 7th. <eos> Who is playing? <eos> The Chiefs versus the Patriots.
That is true. <eos> What are the Eagles chances this year? <eos> I think they will be better, especially Carson Wentz.
Well starting at the bottom, as I said will be Jacksonville. <eos> And working your way up? <eos> Argh! It's tough. I'm torn between Houston and Indy.
He is good. <eos> Who are their other players? <eos> Eric abron is the tight end.
He is a really good value to the team. <eos> What are the teams colors? <eos> It is like a teal blue.
They definitely dominated their respective positions. <eos> What do you think about Dick Butkus? <eos> I was too young, but I heard he is phenomenal.
Maybe, but he's already late-thirties in age. <eos> What about Sean Payton and his prospects for another Super Bowl? <eos> He'll probably get back there again.
Okay, we'll do it then. <eos> I can bring some snacks. What do you like to eat? <eos> Just about anything.
Hopefully they are good enough to help turn the team around. <eos> Have they found their quarterback yet? <eos> I sure hope so.
I think it's between Cody Kessler and Deshone Kizer. <eos> Deshone Kizer went to Notre Dame, didn't he? <eos> Yes he did. The Browns took him in the second round.
Yes he did. The Browns took him in the second round. <eos> Who do you think their best player is? <eos> I would say that it would have to be Joe Thomas.
For sure, the Redskins will be good too. <eos> You don't think the Cowboys are better? <eos> I think that Cousins is the better quarterback.
Yes, I'm excited to see him out there. <eos> Do they still have Cruz? <eos> I'm not sure, I'll read up on that.
Yes, many people have become very wealthy because of the NFL. <eos> So, what's the problem? <eos> The biggest problem is player safety.
The biggest problem is player safety. <eos> How so? <eos> The players are becoming increasingly concerned about CTE.
There is no doubt about it in my opinion. <eos> How long have you been watching the NFL? <eos> I have probably been watching for nearly fifty years.
Maybe. <eos> What do you think of the Tennessee Titan? <eos> They made some good moves in the off season.
I just saw highlights from Superbowl IX. <eos> Who played? <eos> Pittsburgh Steelers and the Minnesota Vikings.
Right, this was Pittsburgh's first Superbowl victory. <eos> Who were the quarterbacks? <eos> Terry Bradshaw for Pittsburgh and Fran Tarkenton for Minnesota.

The fact that he had all those guys behind him. <eos> Like who? <eos> Dez and Zeke for starters.
I like Aaron Rodgers the most. <eos> Really? You don't like Brady? <eos> I like him but Rodgers is more fun to watch.
I like him but Rodgers is more fun to watch. <eos> What do you mean? <eos> He's more athletic and has a stronger arm.
Yes, and he even got two MVP's. <eos> Who else does that? <eos> I don't know, but that is pretty amazing.
Sure is. <eos> What other brothers have been in the NFL? <eos> The Watt brothers play for the Texans and Chargers.
Next would be Antonio Brown. <eos> What position does he play again? <eos> Wide receiver.
Yes it is. <eos> Do you think Atlanta will make it again? <eos> I don't know. Sometimes you only get one shot.
That probably is true, just wrong era in the game. <eos> What about Cardinal great Jim Hart? <eos> I don't know, he doesn't really have that 'wow' factor.
Yeah, they weren't bad. <eos> Didn't they make the playoffs? <eos> I think so, but got bounced by the Patriots or something.
Yes, I have a lot of jerseys from the different teams. <eos> How did you get them all? <eos> Some are from sporting goods stores and others are from auctions.
Some are from sporting goods stores and others are from auctions. <eos> Do you have autographed jerseys? <eos> Yes, I won an autographed Franco Harris jersey.
I also collect football cards. <eos> How old is your most antique one? <eos> I have some from the 1960's.
They are sweet. <eos> What other collectibles do you enjoy? <eos> Well, I like my Eagles coats the best.
Yes absolutely. I love pro football. <eos> Which one is your favorite team? <eos> I've been following the San Francisco 49ers for a while now.
That's true. Joe Montana, Jerry Rice, Ronnie Lott, Steve Young. <eos> Those guys were great. How is the team now? <eos> They moved their home, so they're headquartered elsewhere.
They moved their home, so they're headquartered elsewhere. <eos> Okay, what else? <eos> They hired a couple of coaches to replace Jim Harbaugh.
It was tough to swallow but it will be better soon. <eos> It's not better now? <eos> No but time will heal it.
Me too. I want it back. <eos> Everything gets better with time though, right? <eos> Everything in NFL football at least.
I know! I love drinking and watching games on the weekend. <eos> What network do you like watching the best? <eos> I prefer Fox. They have better graphics over CBS.
Only two of them are. <eos> Which ones? <eos> One is the Decatur Staleys which became the Chicago Bears.
One is the Decatur Staleys which became the Chicago Bears. <eos> Who is the other one? <eos> That would be the Chicago Cardinals which became the Arizona Cardinals.
Close. They actually joined in 1921. <eos> What about the AFL. Were they founded back then, too? <eos> No. They actually weren't founded until 1960.
I don't like his attitude. <eos> I don't either.  What about as a player? <eos> I guess it is fun to watch him play.
I follow the Ravens and Eagles, but that's about it. <eos> But you watch the Superbowl no matter what, right? <eos> Oh, of course.
Oh, of course. <eos> What did you think of this years Superbowl? <eos> Extremely disappointing at first, but then WOW.
That's exactly how I felt. <eos> So you wanted the Pats to win? <eos> Yeah, definitely.
Ohh, I like the cheer leaders too. <eos> Do you think the players are overpaid? <eos> yes.
I think the chargers will be better. <eos> Really? The chargers? <eos> They were 1-8 in games decided by a touchdown or less.
Well there's also Joe Haden. <eos> How far do you expect them to go this year? <eos> I'll admit they would be lucky to win five games.
I'll admit they would be lucky to win five games. <eos> Who do you think they may win against? <eos> It depends which team shows up to play. Possibly the Bengals.
He was a player for the Dallas Cowboys. <eos> Interesting.  What position did he play? <eos> He played safety and played on special teams.
I'd say maybe JaMarcus Russell. <eos> The quaterback? <eos> Yeah I think he's the worst player statistically speaking.
It really showed on the feild man. He was a disaster. <eos> What ever happened to him? <eos> He no longer plays for the NFL. No team wanted him.
I just saw highlights from Superbowl XXII. <eos> Who played in that one? <eos> The Redskins against Denver.

Oh, okay. <eos> Makes sense, right? <eos> Yes, it does.
Oh man, are you negative. <eos> Shrug...if he was any good he'd be starting, right? <eos> Right...
They had the lead last year but let it go. <eos> Didn't they lose in overtime? <eos> Yes, the Patriots came back and beat them.
Maybe someday I will see the Lombardi trophy hoisted in person. <eos> Who is the trophy named after? <eos> Vince Lombardi, one of the all time greats.
I knew that. I guess my mind blanked. <eos> Where is the next Superbowl to be held? <eos> It will be hosted at U.S. Bank stadium.
It will be hosted at U.S. Bank stadium. <eos> Who plays there? <eos> That is the Vikings stadium.
An unimpressive year last year, but expect better. <eos> What about the defensive side? <eos> There are a couple of bright spots.

I just ordered some football tickets for next season. <eos> for the detroit Lions? <eos> Yes, they are our home team after all.
For sure. I was surprised, too. <eos> So how has the team been doing lately? <eos> They're ranked third right now.
They're ranked third right now. <eos> Behind who? <eos> The Green Bay Packers and the Chicago Bears.
Oh I see what you mean. Yes that would be cool. <eos> Do you know the farthest fieldgoal in the NFL history? <eos> No, I do not.
Actually I do! I'm a big Pittsburg Steelers fan. <eos> What kind of stuff do you collect? <eos> Well, lots, I've got a few jerseys.
Well, lots, I've got a few jerseys. <eos> Any favorites? <eos> Maybe Ben Roethlisberger's? I wear it when I watch playoff games.
Maybe Ben Roethlisberger's? I wear it when I watch playoff games. <eos> Anything else? <eos> Basically anything I can get my hands on. Bumper stickers, T-shirts...

Well, for starters, Tom Brady might be the GOAT. <eos> You think he is greater than Joe Montana? <eos> I think his last superbowl definitely put him over the edge.
I think his last superbowl definitely put him over the edge. <eos> So who else would you put on that list? <eos> Well, I think Montana, of course, and also players like Elway.
Well the first two games can be tough. <eos> Who do they play? <eos> They open at home with the saints.
I'm checking out the highlights from the game. <eos> What happened? <eos> Looks like the Lions won by a landslide.
I've always wanted to go to a Superbowl game. <eos> What, like sit the crowd and watch in real time? <eos> Exactly, I feel like it would be a great experience.
Well I hope that comes true for you. <eos> Well what about you, have you ever been to a Superbowl? <eos> Not personally, but my brother has.
Dallas Cowboys which happens to be my dads team. <eos> And which one of those do you root for? <eos> I do not like either team.

16-0, Raiders. <eos> Who was in the halftime show? <eos> The New Mickey Mouse Club.
I really don't know that much about the NFL. <eos> What do you mean? <eos> Like, I don't even know what it stands for.
That could describe a lot of QBs, I guess. <eos> I guess so but is it him or the team? <eos> Maybe they haven't put a good enough team around him.
Only when my team plays, really. <eos> Who is your team? <eos> Used to be the Dolphins but now I like the Panthers.
I'd go with Tyron Smith. <eos> How is that controversial? <eos> I don't know.  I just thought you'd say somebody different.
Not really, I am not that into football to be honest. <eos> Why? <eos> Because everything about it just seems overrated. Kind of like Soccor.
Hear, hear. <eos> You nervous about your first timer? <eos> McDermott? Nah, he'll do fine.
Well, i think it's going to be a very uneventful game. <eos> How so? <eos> Well, nomo Romo for starters, the Rams arent that great so.....
Sorry, but both teams need a serious reboot. <eos> Any other teams in the same boat or worse off? <eos> Well, Jacksonville always.
Giants and Jets are gonna struggle Pre-Season too. <eos> Giants? <eos> Yeah, there not bringing the excitement.
I love it! I am a big fan. <eos> So do you have a favorite team in the NFL? <eos> My favorite team is the Cleveland Browns.
My favorite team is the Cleveland Browns. <eos> What? Are you being serious or are you just joking around? <eos> I am totally serious.
He had a breakout year last year and he's uncoverable. <eos> Ok.  And who is that? <eos> Julio Jones.  He was outstanding last year.
Actually I ended up going to a 49ers games. <eos> You did? Was it fun? <eos> Tons! I hadn't been to a football game in ages.
Tons! I hadn't been to a football game in ages. <eos> Who was playing? <eos> It was the 49ers vs the Seahawks.
It was! I got really into it. <eos> Who won in the end? <eos> The 49ers. It was great.
We actually watched them play the ravens last year. <eos> They lost that one didnt they? <eos> They sure did.
I'm hoping they'll actually utilize their draft picks. <eos> Maybe.  What about Cleveland? <eos> No way.  They can't pick a good player at all.
They really have, I'm surprised they haven't retired yet. <eos> Peyton is a part of the Patriots, right? <eos> Yep, not sure what team Eli is on though.
Yep, not sure what team Eli is on though. <eos> They probably aren't on the same team, I'm assuming? <eos> Probably not, conflict of interest maybe.
I feel like they'll play until they can't even walk. <eos> How many superbowls have they been both in, do you think? <eos> Oh, too many to count.
I just saw highlights from Superbowl XXV. <eos> Who played in that one? <eos> The Buffalo Bills against the New York Giants.

Yea, and he can dance to. <eos> What do you mean? <eos> I think he won Dancing with the Stars.
I think he won Dancing with the Stars. <eos> No way! Really? <eos> Yea, you should watch it on youtube or something.
I've seen a few crazy predictions. <eos> What have you seen? <eos> I've seen Tennessee predicted to win 13 games.
Not much to be honest with you. <eos> But they're getting better don't you think? <eos> Their defense is getting better, not the offense.
Well I certainly think they are better than the Jets. <eos> Ok, who isnt better than the jets? But really Patriots, Dolphins? <eos> The fins are terrible they haven't done anything relevant in years.
Yeah, these guys play well together. <eos> What are your thoughts on Lurie? <eos> I like him as an owner. He is a fan first.
Oh, you are a cheese head! Mine is the Cardinals. <eos> They are not bad, you in AZ? <eos> Used to be, now in Nashville.
David Johnson. <eos> He's new? <eos> Kinda, he is young and really good.
That's good. <eos> How do you think Packers will do this season? <eos> I think they will do good.
Oh yeah. Can't wait to see my Giants in action. <eos> You think they will make it to the superbowl this year? <eos> I hope so, they have not been there since 2012.
They probably have the worst stable of QB's in the league. <eos> Who's their starter, isn't it Geno Smith? <eos> Nah, he's on some other team now.
He retired. <eos> So he won a Superbowl and then quit playing? <eos> Overall, he actually won two Superbowls during his career.
Don't forget he got bonuses as well. <eos> Bonuses for what? <eos> Just for signing.
Yeah I think thats better. <eos> Would it eliminate commercials though? <eos> I think it would almost have to.
You should.  Also talked about finances. <eos> Really? <eos> They said that most NFL players go broke after retirement.
I'm sure they can all benefit. <eos> Any interviews? <eos> Oh, plenty.
Yeah, I was a Packers fan growing up. <eos> You mean before the Rams came? <eos> Yeah.
Yeah. <eos> So are you gonna go back to the pack? <eos> Eh. I think so. They are pretty good though.
Eh. I think so. They are pretty good though. <eos> Isn't that a good thing? <eos> Not really. I want to buy low.
Not really. I want to buy low. <eos> Buy low? <eos> Yeah I don't want to look like a bandwagoner.
So they, or someone on the Patriots, was deflating the balls. <eos> What does that do, game-wise? <eos> It's softer. So it's easier to both throw and catch.
I know, but I didn't think you'd go ancient on me. <eos> Ok, fine, who is your all time favorite? <eos> Joe Montana.
Yep, he won two years in a row, 1989 and 1990. <eos> For what team? <eos> The San Francisco 49ers of course.
I really think Joey Bosa is a special talent. <eos> Is he the defensive end from Ohio State? <eos> Yes, he was outstanding for the buckeyes in his time there.
Oh Lord. <eos> What's wrong? <eos> That means I won't hear from you again until February.
Yep. He went to the Oakland Raiders. <eos> Only for a couple of years, though, right? <eos> Yep.  He didn't pan out there at all either.
Yes, and the Cardinals won the second. <eos> Do you think the Cardinals will win the West this year? <eos> I don't know. It's Larry's last year.
I don't know. It's Larry's last year. <eos> Who is Larry? <eos> Larry Fitzpatrick. The wide receiver.
Yes, I believe so. <eos> Do you think they will do well for his last year? <eos> I hope so, yes. They should.
I think Nate Newton was the best. <eos> Remember Jay Novaceck? <eos> Yes, and there was also Charles Haley.
Yes it is. I've got my Sunday's booked then. <eos> How're the Bears looking this year? <eos> They're a mess, as usual.
They're a mess, as usual. <eos> Yeah, why so? <eos> Starting at the top, the QB situation is questionable at best.
Not since Singletary, Tomzack and Perry were on the team. <eos> When was that? <eos> Probably mid 80's I think.
Probably mid 80's I think. <eos> That was a while ago. How old were you? <eos> I think somewhere around 12 or 13 I think.
Yes but it was more than that. <eos> What do you mean? <eos> Well in truth I loved watching the three of them play.
Maybe not but he was fun to watch play. <eos> What position did Singletary play? <eos> He was a linebacker and is now a coach.
He was a linebacker and is now a coach. <eos> Who was Perry? <eos> William Perry was a defensive lineman.
I'm sorry to say I'm a fan of the Cleveland Browns. <eos> What's wrong with being a fan of the Browns? <eos> Nothing I guess, it's just they have a bad record.
Nothing I guess, it's just they have a bad record. <eos> This year or consistently? <eos> Consistently. They were 3–13 year before last.
Yes, yes it is. <eos> Who did they choose with that draft pick? <eos> They drafted Myles Garrett.
They drafted Myles Garrett. <eos> Is he a quarterback? <eos> No, he's a defensive end.
It would be, but you can't. <eos> Why not? <eos> Neither network saved the footage.
Andrew Luck has to make the leap this year. <eos> If he doesn't now when will he? <eos> I don't knwo he's almost 30.
Yeah, I like the NFL. <eos> Have you ever been to a game? <eos> No.
Haha, yeah. <eos> Who's next on the list? <eos> Raiders and Steelers. Those may be a bit harder.
In my opinion it's a lot more fun to watch. <eos> What do you think that's attributable to? <eos> I think the game is just constantly evolving.
I really like that fast guy they drafted. <eos> Tye Hill? <eos> Yeah, that dude stole the show last year.
Maybe, I don't know yet. <eos> Are you excited for the new season? <eos> Not really, I'm still kind of burned out from last season.
Not really, I'm still kind of burned out from last season. <eos> What makes you say that? <eos> I'm just sick of this team.
I'm just sick of this team. <eos> So are you just done with them? <eos> I wouldn't say that with any certainty.
Yes! I have loved them ever since I was a child. <eos> Who is your all time favorite player in franchise history? <eos> I would have to say Steve McNair would be my favorite.
Yes, but that's not the only reason. <eos> Why else? <eos> Many early professional football players were Native Americans.
They were called the Oorang Indians. <eos> Where were they based? <eos> It was in LaRue, Ohio.
It was in LaRue, Ohio. <eos> Where's that? <eos> It's near Marion, Ohio. Marion is in between Toledo and Cleveland.
Yes. <eos> Who is your favorite team? <eos> I like the Atlanta Falcons.
No. <eos> Would you like to see one? <eos> That might be fun.
I watch it every year. <eos> Whose your favorite player? <eos> My favorite player has been retired awhile.
My favorite player has been retired awhile. <eos> Who is it? <eos> Ray Lewis.
He was a beacon of light for the Ravens defense. <eos> Who do you like? <eos> Someone who is also retired.
Someone who is also retired. <eos> Who would that be? <eos> Brian Urlacher.
Packer fans are very knowledgeable. 99.9% are well behaved. <eos> Who is your favorite current Packer? <eos> I would say Aaron Rodgers.
I would say Aaron Rodgers. <eos> Why is he your favorite? <eos> Because he makes spectacular plays out of broken plays.
It makes evaluating teams really difficult. <eos> Are you still  Steeler's fan? <eos> Big Ben all the way! I have my towel ready.
A lot of cities have Steeler fan bars. <eos> Who do you think will make the Super Bowl this year? <eos> I think the Giants have a good chance.
Well, Peyton Manning's retired. And his team's doing okay. <eos> Okay, what else is new? <eos> Uhhh, not much.
Uhhh, not much. <eos> What about the sports commentators? <eos> Uhhh, nothing special about them.
Well, it's not interesting to me. <eos> Uhhh, then why are you talking about some cool football players? <eos> Cause, it's just part of mingling.
We'll see. <eos> Is Marcus Mariotta's ankle healed yet? <eos> Probably, i'll have to look it up.
I just saw highlights from Superbowl XXIV. <eos> Who played in that one? <eos> San Francisco against Denver.
Pat Summerall and John Madden. <eos> Who were the quarterbacks? <eos> Joe Montana for the 49ers and John Elway for the Broncos.
Joe Montana for the 49ers and John Elway for the Broncos. <eos> Who scored first? <eos> San Francisco, touchdown pass from Montana to Rice.

A field goal. <eos> What was the halftime score? <eos> 27-3, 49ers.
27-3, 49ers. <eos> What happened in the rest of the game? <eos> A 55-10 blowout by the 49ers.
Yea, they still have Russell Wilson. <eos> Would you want to count on him? <eos> Yea, I think so. He has proven enough.
Tom Brady, definitely. <eos> I take it you're a New England Patriots fan then? <eos> Not really. I'm just stating facts.
The Falcons? I'm asking about the 2016 game. <eos> Yeah, Patriots versus Falcons, wasn't it? <eos> I think the Patriots won that one.
I think the Patriots won that one. <eos> Oh, well why did you ask then? <eos> I don't know, I guess your wrong answer fueled my memory.
Of course they have, but they've won so much lately. <eos> They have like 5 titles, don't they? <eos> Something like that, I know other teams have more though.
I know for certain the Packers have won the most titles. <eos> Since the NFL was created? <eos> Yep, they've won 13.
I could get into that. <eos> Do you know who to invite? <eos> Kevin is really excited about the new season for the Raiders.
I wanted to visit the Lincoln Financial Field. <eos> Is that for Baseball for something? <eos> No it is for the Eagles Football team.
I sure hope so. <eos> When's the last time the Steelers won the Super Bowl? <eos> It was 2009.
You probably need an invitation as well. <eos> Tickets seem to be hard to get, aren't they? <eos> Yes, I think the president even goes to the game sometimes.
No doubt, and some football purists would call their gameplan genius. <eos> So when do you think they will fall as a dynasty? <eos> That's easy, whenever Belichick or Brady retires.
Probably the Buffalo Bills. <eos> Why do you think them? <eos> They have no quarterback, and no defense.
I couldn't believe it. <eos> So he got them a win? <eos> Basically.
Miami over Minnesota, second team to win consecutive Superbowls. <eos> Who were the quarterbacks? <eos> Bob Griese for Miami, Fran Tarkenton for the Vikings.
Bob Griese for Miami, Fran Tarkenton for the Vikings. <eos> Where did they play? <eos> Rice Stadium, Houston.
17-0. <eos> Who was in the halftime show? <eos> The Texas Longhorns band and Miss Texas.
Miami scored once more in the third to make it 24-0. <eos> When did the Vikings score? <eos> Fourth quarter, four yard run.
Fourth quarter, four yard run. <eos> Who made the touchdown? <eos> Fran Tarkenton on a scramble.
I agree, but great middle linebackers are rare. <eos> How about best QBs? who is on your top 5 list? <eos> I'll go with Montana, Unitas, Marino, Brady, and Manning.
Exactly, I do like a good tail gate party though. <eos> Me too! Do you watch games with your friends? <eos> Sometimes, if I get invited.
Sometimes, if I get invited. <eos> Oh, so it's either with them or not at all? <eos> Yeah, unless it's a team I like playing.
Yeah, unless it's a team I like playing. <eos> Who do you like? <eos> The Vikings, Steelers, Packers....
My Bengals were trash last year. <eos> Huge trash.  What happened there? <eos> Things just fell apart.  Couldn't score, couldn't defend.
I'm a Seattle Seahawks fan. <eos> So you're referring to replacing Marshawn Lynch? <eos> Yes, hopefully our new running back will provide what we need.
Yes, hopefully our new running back will provide what we need. <eos> Who is the new running back? <eos> We traded for Eddie Lacy.
Absolutely. <eos> What team are you rooting for? <eos> I'm rooting for the Eagles this season.
Football goes all year long. <eos> What do you mean? <eos> I mean the business of football goes all year.
The draft picks are chosen. <eos> Oh yeah? <eos> Yeah.  I've been following Ivan Smith.
They're hoping he's strong enough for the league. <eos> Why? <eos> Because he only weighs 156 lbs.
Because he only weighs 156 lbs. <eos> That's small. Height? <eos> I think he's about 6 feet.
He has to gain weight. <eos> Is it a requirement? <eos> I'm sure it's not, but recommended.
The defense will be better too. <eos> Why? <eos> Because Cam Heyward and Bud Dupree are both injury free.
They lacked manpower this season. <eos> How? <eos> Two top players out for the season.
Two top players out for the season. <eos> Which ones? <eos> Alfred Wooten and Colin Pores.
I think they will be. <eos> You do? <eos> Next season they'll be more prepared.
Next season they'll be more prepared. <eos> Will the guys come back next season? <eos> Not sure but hopefully.
I know that Kirk Cousins is on the team. <eos> What position is he? <eos> He is a quarterback.
Specifically north east, I would assume. <eos> Yeah, I wonder where the NFL was formed? <eos> I believe Ohio, if I'm not mistaken.
And the offensive line was just standing there getting smack. <eos> Then they finally started to play some football. Remember? <eos> Yeah, it was kind of funny, I thought.
Not really. <eos> Why not? <eos> I like a lot of teams.
No one could get past him. <eos> Who else is your favorite all timer? <eos> I liked Jim McMahon.
It's like fantasy football, but with the local paper. <eos> How do you win? <eos> You guess which teams will win.
The Broncos are my team. <eos> Who is their prospect this year? <eos> Garrett Bolles is looking good for them.
Garrett Bolles is looking good for them. <eos> What team does he come from? <eos> He is a recruit out of Utah.
He is a recruit out of Utah. <eos> What position does he play? <eos> He is an outstanding blocker.
I don't think anything about the San Diego Chargers. <eos> What do you mean? <eos> The Charger franchise moved to L.A. The Raiders are moving too.
The Charger franchise moved to L.A. The Raiders are moving too. <eos> The Raiders are moving? To where? <eos> They're gonna be going to Las Vegas.
Yeah, but he'll be long gone before they actually move. <eos> Why is that? <eos> Well they won't be moving for a few years I guess.
And then some states have no teams. <eos> Where are all the multiples? <eos> Well California has a bunch.
Well California has a bunch. <eos> They have Oakland, San Francisco, LA and San Diego right? <eos> Yeah.  Four teams in one state.
Yeah.  Four teams in one state. <eos> What about Florida.  How many do they have? <eos> They have Jacksonville and Tampa Bay.
They have Jacksonville and Tampa Bay. <eos> What about the Dolphins? <eos> Oh yes, I forgot Miami.
It was easy for me. <eos> Why is that? <eos> I grew up in Wisconsin.
Yes, yes I am. <eos> Did you watch the Draft? <eos> Yes, I watched the Draft.
Yes, I watched the Draft. <eos> Who did your favorite team get? <eos> They drafted Tre'Davious White.
They drafted Tre'Davious White. <eos> What position does he play? <eos> He played cornerback in college.
I believe so. They got it from Kansas City. <eos> Is Alex still with the Chiefs? <eos> Yes, Alex smith? I believe so.
Nah, you saw David Johnson. He's young and super talented. <eos> What position does he play? <eos> He's a running back.
Then everybody else is bunched together. <eos> Who's predictions are these? <eos> This is from ESPN.
I think the Raiders have a great chance of winning. <eos> How will Carr bounce back from injury? <eos> Carr seems like a hard worker who will come back strong.
That would be exciting. <eos> How many touchdowns does he have so far this season? <eos> I think he's at 7.
I know, but they can take steps to prevent concussions. <eos> How so? <eos> First, they need to change the game.
First, they need to change the game. <eos> What do you mean? <eos> The game needs to move away from impact and towards skill.
Well I can't wait for the season to kick off. <eos> What teams do you follow? <eos> I like the Dolphins and Arizona Cardinals.
I think the Eagles stadium is pretty neat. <eos> How so? <eos> Well, they've got incredible food and seating.
Well, they've got incredible food and seating. <eos> Did they just build that stadium? <eos> Not too long ago.
Yes,I think they are going to be pretty bad again. <eos> Who is the starting quarterback? <eos> I think it's going to be Brock Osweiler myself.
That's a great point. <eos> How is,their schedule? <eos> It looks pretty soft.
I'd also be remiss to not include Earl Thomas. <eos> Didn't he get injured though? <eos> Yeah, he did, but he completes that secondary.
I like their running back. <eos> Oh yeah, what's his name again? <eos> His name is Ezekiel Elliott.
Outside of just the drug problem a ton of quarterbacks bust. <eos> Yeah you know who else busted hard? <eos> JaMarcus Russell.
Nah, I feel like rules would change as time goes on. <eos> Why do you think that? <eos> Well, birth of technology, emergence of illegal tactics....
The writer is Dan Graziano. <eos> Who does he have them beating? <eos> The Minnesota Vikings.
Quite a bit I think. <eos> Isn't the SUPERBOWL in Minnesota? <eos> Yes it is.
Yes, he is great too - on the Seahawks. <eos> What do you think of Vinatieri? <eos> I think he is arguably the greatest of all time.
I think he is arguably the greatest of all time. <eos> What makes you say that? <eos> He has so many big moments and has been consistently great.
Right, which is the mistake I think the Bears made. <eos> Boy the Niners sure did well in the draft huh? <eos> Yeah for being a brand new gm, John Lynch did alright.
Yes, there has been. <eos> What league? <eos> The American Football League existed in the 1960s.
The American Football League existed in the 1960s. <eos> What happened to it? <eos> It merged with the NFL in 1969.
It merged with the NFL in 1969. <eos> Were there others? <eos> Yes, there were at least three others.
Yes, there were at least three others. <eos> What were those leagues called? <eos> Interestingly, they had the same name.
Yes, but they all rivaled the NFL at different times. <eos> When? <eos> These rival leagues started in 1926, 1936, 1940, and 1960, respectfully.
I know, the stadium there that Jerry Jones built looks incredible. <eos> Are they still having Thursday Night Football every week this year? <eos> I think so.  I don't like Thursday night games either.
Yeah he had a propensity for making dumb decisions quickly. <eos> Who else was terrible in his era? <eos> There were a ton of Cutler types throughout the league.
I don't think they'll win 5 games. <eos> You think they're that bad? <eos> I know they are.
I know they are. <eos> Who's the starting quarterback? <eos> I don't believe they even know.
I don't believe they even know. <eos> Do you think josh McGowan will start? <eos> I don't know.
To say the least. <eos> Do you think Bryce petty will be any good? <eos> It's possible he can turn out ok.
Me too. Welcome, nation. <eos> Yes, indeed. Who is your favorite Steelers player? <eos> I love Antonio.
I love Antonio. <eos> Antonio Bryant? The wide receiver? <eos> Yes, the wide receiver.
Exactly my reaction. <eos> What happened then? <eos> Detroit kicked a winning feild goal in a sudden death overtime.
It's even worse for Buffalo. <eos> Why is that? <eos> They went four years in a row and lost them all.
I would have to say John Madden. <eos> How come? <eos> He has the highest winning percentage for a regular season.
Yeah I tend to echo that same sentiment. <eos> Do you think he can be an MVP? <eos> Yes and maybe even this year.
Me too! At least I was a fan. <eos> Oh no! What happened? <eos> They left Saint Louis.
They left Saint Louis. <eos> Yes, yes they did. Are members of your family still fans? <eos> Some are, some aren't. I couldn't imagine still being a fan.
Not really, it's not as hard as some other things. <eos> How do you think Geoff will do? <eos> I hope well. We spent a first round pick on him.
I hope well. We spent a first round pick on him. <eos> How has he done so far? <eos> Not well. He has a losing record overall.
Yes, I actually did watch all three days. <eos> Really? Who is your team? <eos> I am a browns fan.
You got that right. Embarrassing. <eos> Who do you think will take it all this year? <eos> It would be tough to go against the Patriots.
It is.  I would start with the returning Superbowl champs. <eos> The Patriots? <eos> Yup.
I would agree with that. <eos> Then who do you think number three would be? <eos> I think the Raiders.
That is probably a good choice. <eos> And at five? <eos> I would say Packers.
If so, he will be missed. He's so fun to watch. <eos> I know. right?  How great was that Superbowl game? <eos> Such a heartbreaking ending.  We should have won it.
It was for Noxema Cream. <eos> What's that? <eos> It's a shaving cream.
Your turn. <eos> Turn? Are we playing a game? <eos> Sure, why not, lets make it a game.
I'm glued to this interview. <eos> Who is the player? <eos> Eddie Smith.
He's a tank. <eos> I concur.  What'd he say? <eos> Talked about his childhood and college years in football.
They went to school with him. <eos> Really though? <eos> They were friends.
Absolutely, I think itll be even better. <eos> After Seattle who else could be it? <eos> I think thats really it.
Hope they make it to the Super Bowl this year. <eos> Who's your favorite player? <eos> I loved Washington but we let him go.
It is Sunday, September 10th at Noon. <eos> Who are they playing? <eos> The Titans are playing the Oakland Raiders.
You probably did because it's in downtown Nashville. <eos> Oh, right. When's the second home game? <eos> It is on September 24 against the Seahawks.
He's doing well. It's nice to see him playing again. <eos> He is kind of large, right? <eos> Yes, that's accurate. He weighs 243 pounds.
They're that close? I wouldn't have guessed. <eos> I know right? <eos> Exactly. He just is taller.
Maybe we'll make it to the playoffs this year. <eos> Your really think so? <eos> No, but I hope we do.
I know.  I think they'll eventually like football, though. <eos> What other games do you want to see? <eos> I would like to see the Eagles play the Redskins.
Yes I do. <eos> Which team is that? <eos> It is the Packers.

Up with People, saluting big bands. <eos> Thrilling.  What happened in the end? <eos> Pittsburgh won, 31-19.
I really don't like the Bears. <eos> Understandable. So, I guess you're a Packers fan? <eos> I'm more partial to the Packers, yeah.
True, they did pick up a tight end, though. <eos> They got Sheenan, right? <eos> Yeah, and Trubinsky as a quarterback.
It's okay. <eos> What do you like about it? <eos> I like the Super Bowl.
Oh, this is Miami. <eos> Why are the uniforms periwinkle blue? <eos> I think they are more like seafoam blue.
Yeah, doesn't mean i have to like it. <eos> So you don't watch any college football? <eos> Nope, doesn't excite me one bit.
Sorry, the scores and the plays are unrealistic. <eos> You think? <eos> I really do.
I was thinking we should have a superbowl party this year. <eos> That sounds like fun! What teams are playing again? <eos> This year it's the Patriots and the Falcons.
Not good... <eos> What happened? <eos> Looks like he is on his way out.
He also has a charity. <eos> What is the name of his charity? <eos> It's called the Mirer Family Foundation.

I'm thinking it will be the Lions. <eos> Really? <eos> Yeah, I think this is their year.

That's true, it could happen this year. <eos> What team made the Super Bowl the most? <eos> The Patriots and Steelers have made it a lot.
My thoughts exactally. <eos> Who replaced him on the Jets? <eos> I don't know, i'll have to look it up.
You score the most points. <eos> How do you score points? <eos> Well, you either get a touchdown, or through a kick.
Well, you either get a touchdown, or through a kick. <eos> Which is worth more? <eos> A touchdown.
Yes, but it didn't happen all at once. <eos> What happened? <eos> The Browns franchise became dormant for several years.
The Browns franchise became dormant for several years. <eos> When did it return? <eos> The Browns again took the field in 1999.
They have no playoff wins during that time. <eos> Have they even made it to the playoffs? <eos> Yes, in 2002, they made it. But, they immediately lost.
Yes, in 2002, they made it. But, they immediately lost. <eos> How about winning seasons? <eos> They have had only two winning seasons in the new millenium.

I heard Romo is going to be a broadcaster for CBS. <eos> Are there any other big names retiring this year? <eos> Jay Cutler and Mike Vick are both retiring.
That one I knew. <eos> What's the name of their field? <eos> I beileve it's the Lincoln Financial Field.
I beileve it's the Lincoln Financial Field. <eos> Did they just remodel that? <eos> I'm not sure.
They are typically tears. <eos> What actually tears? <eos> Either the meniscus or the ligament tears.
Either the meniscus or the ligament tears. <eos> How do doctors fix this damage? <eos> It takes reconscruction surgery. They use grafts from other locations.

I have to yes on that too. <eos> Do they win? <eos> Yes they win.
You mean Eli Manning? He plays for the Giants. <eos> No, the other one. His brother? <eos> Payton Manning? He retired and does insurance commercial on TV.
Yeah, Clay Matthews. He's funny. <eos> Not a bad player either. He is a defensive player, right? <eos> Yeah, kinda mean player. Effective though.
Yeah, and so is Tom Brady. <eos> How many Super Bowls you think the Pats are gonna take? <eos> Most likely 10 or more, depending on Brady's health and performance.
Oh, him. <eos> He's pretty good, right? <eos> Yes, indeed.
Sort of, whenever I have the time, really. <eos> Well aren't they always on Sunday? <eos> Yeah, but there's usually several games at once.
It is, but I just love so many teams. <eos> Which teams do you like? <eos> I like the Steelers, I like the Packers....
Oh god, another one that's not my cup of tea. <eos> And what's wrong with them? <eos> I just think they are wayyyy overhyped.
Oh, good, because I prefer professional football to college football. <eos> Why? <eos> I don't know.  Calliber of play I suppose.
He was released. <eos> Wow the cowboys released him? <eos> Yeah they released him in April of 2017.
Oh yeah, he was UGA's quarterback. <eos> Yep! Are you going to any games? <eos> I hope so, I want to tailgate.
Dude, that's why I watch college football. <eos> I know, remember when Tebow was playing in the NFL? <eos> I remember he was bad at it.
Obviously Eli. <eos> How can you say that? <eos> Because Eli had two rings first.
Yea but that alone doesn't make him better. <eos> How so? <eos> Peyton is taller, bigger, and has more experience.
Again, it's because he's an older player. <eos> How many pro bowl nominations does eli have? <eos> 3 I think.
I have a few favorites that never made the Superbowl. <eos> Like who? <eos> McNair was a guy I liked, mostly quarterbacks.
I think so? I've never drawn out a map or anything. <eos> So what teams do you like then? <eos> I like the Oakland Raiders. They seem like underdogs.
Oh, yeah. I guess I do that. <eos> Why? <eos> I think it just makes it more exciting.
We didn't make the Superboel, but we will. <eos> When? <eos> One day.
I have faith in them turning things around. <eos> What do you think there record will be this coming season? <eos> Well I would say maybe 8-8.
You cant get physical in football because of the risk. <eos> Would guaranteeing contracts help that out? <eos> No because they almost already do that with signing bonuses.
Yes, from time to time I do. <eos> What is your favorite team? <eos> I like the Denver Broncos.
I like the Denver Broncos. <eos> Is Peyton Manning still there? <eos> No, he retired a few years ago.
No, he retired a few years ago. <eos> He won that before he went, though, right? <eos> Yes, he won one after he lost against the Seahawks.
Yes, he won one after he lost against the Seahawks. <eos> Is he in the Hall of Fame yet? <eos> No, you have to wait a certain amount of time.
No, you have to wait a certain amount of time. <eos> Is that so? How long? <eos> I don't know, but at least a few years.
Yeah, very. It is a surprise for my boyfriend. <eos> Is he a big NFL fan? <eos> Yes. Huge fan.
After Miller, it's a toss-up.  I can't decide. <eos> Probably Mack, though right? <eos> See, I can't decide between him or Kuechly.
I would probably say Mack though. <eos> On what grounds? <eos> Well, Mack is faster, younger, a bit less banged up.
Titans are stacking up on their receiving corp. <eos> How's that? <eos> They got Corey Davis AND Taywan Taylor.
You've got a good point. I guess I'm just excited. <eos> Why? <eos> My last college's football team was really bad.
My last college's football team was really bad. <eos> Why don't you start watching some NFL games then? <eos> I guess I could do that.
I think you'd get really into it if you let yourself. <eos> Do you have any teams that you're a big fan of? <eos> I grew up in Minnesota, so I like the Vikings.
I grew up in Minnesota, so I like the Vikings. <eos> And hate the Packers? <eos> Of course. That's practically genetic.
Rivalries like that are always so funny to me. <eos> Why? <eos> They just seem silly. It's such low stakes.
Playoff atmosphere. <eos> You ever go to a playoff game? <eos> No, never a chance at getting tickets for that.
Tough one, man. Let me tell you who I want. <eos> Ok. Who then? <eos> I want the Falcons back.
There have been a few moves recently. <eos> I remember the LA Rams.  Who else? <eos> Well the Raiders have been approved to move.
Well the Raiders have been approved to move. <eos> They have? <eos> Yup, they will be playing out of Vegas.
Yup, they will be playing out of Vegas. <eos> Vegas?  Really? <eos> NFL approved it.
Yeah, and he killed the trials too. <eos> So it looks like it's going to be a running year? <eos> Yeah, but not just that, our quarterback can pass too.
Yeah, but not just that, our quarterback can pass too. <eos> Can he fill Peyton's shoes? <eos> Better than that, he had no interceptions last year.
Better than that, he had no interceptions last year. <eos> What about fumbles? <eos> Yeah, but just the one though, against Jacksonville.
No way he is a born leader. <eos> How do you know? <eos> Look at his college experience, he was great.
Big Brock is 350 pounds. <eos> How big is Ron? <eos> He's pushing 250.
That's gotta hurt bad. <eos> What's his status? <eos> They're tending to him still.
Ok, they're loading him onto the stretcher. <eos> Is he awake? <eos> Barely.
Hopefully they will include a season schedule this time. <eos> For what?  The Pats? <eos> Yeah.
Yes, miss watching some football. <eos> Who you rooting for this year? <eos> The Philedelphia Eagles, the represent my hometown.
They've got Andrew Luck. <eos> Isn't he the highest paid player, or was? <eos> I think so maybe.
I'm really excited about the Raiders this season. <eos> Are they moving to Las Vegas yet? <eos> Not yet, that won't be until 2020.
You should go some time. <eos> Have you been to games? <eos> Yes, a couple of times.
Yes, a couple of times. <eos> Where did you go most recently? <eos> I went to Lambeau Field.

I just saw highlights from Superbowl XIX. <eos> Who played in that one? <eos> Miami against San Francisco.

Yeah, right, right!  That is the story anyway. <eos> Or was it the GW Bridge pilings? <eos> I don't know man.
I don't know man. <eos> You go to any games? <eos> Not too many, we grew up kind of poor.
I guess you could say I'm a Bears fan. <eos> Chicago? Is that where you're from? <eos> Yes.
Yes. <eos> When was the last time they won? <eos> The last year they won was in 1986.
No, he was quite the opposite of that. <eos> I see. Who was the quarterback? <eos> It was Jim McMahon.
I know it is so loud in their new stadium. <eos> Do you think Bridgewater will be back this season? <eos> I hope so, but his injury sounded pretty serious last year.
Mine too, he had such grace on the field. <eos> What do you think of Andre Johnson? <eos> The man is great, but unfortunately just retired.
I miss the big personalities in NFL football. <eos> Like whom? <eos> I'd say Ochocinco was one of them.
Not all of them. <eos> Is Tom Brady still playing? <eos> Not sure.
Yes, he is actually a regular on that show. <eos> Tell me about. Cutler, who thought of this guy? <eos> I can't imagine.
I think they are rotating rookies until his return. <eos> Do they have any new football shows? <eos> They don't really have anything new.
Cam Newton stood out more to me than Roethlisberger ever did. <eos> How on earthy do they strategize by rotating starters? <eos> The Rams had four coaches in five seasons.
Yeah, they were pretty famous back in the day. <eos> Who were some of the players in that group? <eos> Jack Lambert, Mean Joe Greene, Mel Blount.
Jack Lambert, Mean Joe Greene, Mel Blount. <eos> Oh, Joe Greene. He was in that famous Coke commercial right? <eos> Yeah, that's the one. Really famous commercial.

True. <eos> How about Ezekiel Elliot? <eos> He had a great rookie season last year.
The position is a young man's position, though. <eos> I agree with that. But what about the Cowboys' offensive line? <eos> True, they are really good.
I do but not as much as I used to. <eos> Do you have a favorite team? <eos> I enjoy watching the browns.
Ok, That is good to know. <eos> Who are you rooting for this year? <eos> The same team I root for every year, the Chicago Bears.
There's nothing wrong with that. <eos> What team are you interested in this year? <eos> I like the New Orleans Saints.

The state's Department of Transportation has to approve it. <eos> What do you think the chances are with that? <eos> Somebody from the state said they were considering the proposal.

Let's catch the game tonight at my house. <eos> Okay. Who is playing? <eos> The Bears and the 49ers.
I will be there. I may fall asleep though. <eos> Is life hitting hard right now? <eos> Yeah, just exhausted. School is kicking my butt.
i think that was bad coaching when they played the falcons. <eos> what you mean? <eos> in the n f c championship game.
Yeah, Elway was the only hall of famer on the team. <eos> And the 49ers? <eos> They were stacked.
I think I like watching it more at home. <eos> Really? why? <eos> Because I like watching more than one game at a time.
Me too, thankfully pre-season is right around the corner. <eos> Who is your favorite team? <eos> My favorite team is the Detriot Lions.
They have a good chance, but we will see. <eos> Are there any quarterbacks throughout the league that are standouts? <eos> Drew Brees is still with the New Orleans Saints.
I know, it was a good game last night. <eos> Did you see Alex Smith throw all of those passes? <eos> Yes, I believe he threw for 363 yards.

i know that's right. <eos> who you like this season? <eos> i'm riding with tampa bay. i think they win their division.

Of course I will, that's my team. <eos> How many games did they win last year? <eos> They won only once in the entire last year.
And his brother's defense was, of course, trash. <eos> Certified trash. How many games did they lose? <eos> I think at least 9.
And then, of course, y'all have Watkins and McCoy. <eos> Is McCoy still there? <eos> I think so, but maybe not. But still... Watkins and Taylor.
Yes, there is a kicker, punter, and return specialists. <eos> What about the scoring in NFL football? <eos> The game is played in four quarters with a half time.
tampa bay gone have that division on lock. <eos> tampa bay? <eos> you heard me.

Yeah, I know, I can't wait. <eos> What's your favorite team again? <eos> The Atlanta Falcons.
Yes, I am not a Brady fan at all. <eos> Hmm... What did you think of deflate-gate? <eos> It was a bit ridiculous, i'll have to admit that.
True. <eos> Who do you root for? <eos> The packers.
Honestly, I'm expecting another rough year. Maybe 5-11. <eos> Think John Fox gets fired? <eos> It's a definite possibility.
They do all right at home. <eos> I don't know; did you see that Super Bowl? <eos> Well the New England defense came out soft.
With our receivers, we are in any game. <eos> Hey, don't they have to play in Paris this year? <eos> You mean London! I hope not.
I know I am so excited. <eos> Did you ever go to a game in the dome? <eos> Yes, I went last year. It was so much fun.

Yes.  DeShone Kizer in the second round. <eos> Not bad.  Who else do they have to chose from? <eos> Cody Kessler, Brock Ossweiler, and Kevin Hogan.
Yeah, but the beginning of the season holds so much possibility. <eos> Possibility for what? <eos> Possibility for everything and everyone.
Not for everyone. <eos> What do you mean? <eos> It's not fun if your team doesn't make the playoffs.
Yes a lot of doubt s surrounding that subject too actually. <eos> Yes, I don't know how old Brady is now? Do you? <eos> I think he about 41 years old now.
Oh okay, that is old for a quarterback. <eos> How old was Kurt Warner? <eos> I believe he was about the same age as Brady, actaully.
shoot, i think atlanta will pull a carolina. <eos> what you mean? <eos> i think they don't even make the playoffs.
my money was on the patriots. <eos> you know you got lucky right? <eos> luck ain't have nothing to do with it.
Not really, but I used to be a huge fan. <eos> Why don't you follow it closely anymore? <eos> I'm a Cincinnati Bengals fan.
Same as every year, not good. <eos> You really don't like the Dolphins do you? <eos> I think they are an overrated franchise.
I think they will win 6-8 games. <eos> You don't think the will win half their games? <eos> I don't think Ryan Tannehill is that good a quarterback.
Yes. <eos> Who did they play that year? <eos> Vikings.
Those were the best stadiums they had history. <eos> What is the oldest stadium in the NFL? <eos> It's Lambeau Field in Green Bay.
I think the fans like it better. <eos> Are there any players you are looking forward to seeing? <eos> There are some new players that I'm excited about.
I hate the cowboys. <eos> Then who is your favorite team? <eos> I like the Packers.
I think they're ok. <eos> Who is the worst team to you? <eos> I hate the Cleveland Browns.
Tell me about it. <eos> You know my Patriots have it this year, right? <eos> Yeah, they looked good this offseason.
Yeah, they looked good this offseason. <eos> How do the 'Boys look? <eos> I think we're your biggest competition.
It's not what he did, its what he said. <eos> Well, What did he say? <eos> He made a comparison to Eli Manning and Lebron James.
EJ is playing with some real vets. <eos> I absolutely agree. How long is Manning out? <eos> I think he's coming back for the 5th game.
Good bet but I would take a chance on a sleeper. <eos> Who would be your sleeper? <eos> I would pick the Broncos.
Probably the Cowboys. I guess. <eos> What do you mean I guess? <eos> Well, I kind of have a love-hate relationship with them.
Well, I kind of have a love-hate relationship with them. <eos> Why do you hate them? <eos> I don't like their owner; he fired my favourite coach.
I don't like their owner; he fired my favourite coach. <eos> Oh yeah? Who was he? <eos> Well, it was 30 years ago. It was Tom Laundry.
Well, it was 30 years ago. It was Tom Laundry. <eos> Dang, you can certainly hold a grudge. Why was he fired? <eos> They weren't satisfied with his record, I guess.
Well technically the Dallas Cowboys play in Arlington, Texas not Dallas. <eos> Ok, what do you think is the best NFL city? <eos> I think it's Chicago.
I think it's Chicago. <eos> Why Chicago? <eos> They have great fans and love the team.
I guess that's true. <eos> What's the worst NFL city? <eos> That's easy it's Los Angeles.
My favorite player is Matthew Stafford. <eos> Really? Why? <eos> He's a great player.
No, He's just my favorite player. <eos> Do you have other favorite players? <eos> Sure, I have a lot of them.
Sure, I have a lot of them. <eos> What's another one? <eos> JJ Watt is another one of my favorites.
JJ Watt is another one of my favorites. <eos> Why? Because he's so good? <eos> He is really good, but he also puts his team first.

Yeah, he's good, and I like him in fantasy football. <eos> Do you like Carson Palmer at quarterback? <eos> No, not particularly.
He's just not a clutch quarterback. <eos> What do you think about their coaching staff? <eos> That's their strength I believe.
That is over a four year period. <eos> Are these contracts all guaranteed money? <eos> No, unlike the NBA, contracts in the NFL are not guaranteed.

Everyone he threw the ball to dropped passes. <eos> Unbelievable, how did Gabbert do for the 49ers? <eos> He had 170 passing yards and a QB rating of 91.
Yes, many would agree. <eos> Remember their coach at the time? <eos> Of course, Mike Ditka.
Yes, low IQ, and full of ignorance. <eos> Any chance he plays anywhere this year? <eos> No flippin' way. This is a business.
I'm not sure.  I used to love the Buffalo Bills... <eos> It sounds like you don't anymore.  What happened? <eos> Well, my favorite player was Doug Flutie.
Yes. He does have that going for him as well. <eos> Do you think the Panthers will have a good season? <eos> I don't know. They're all over the map lately.

i hate the patriots. <eos> why? <eos> because all they do is win.
I'm a Colts fan. <eos> That's Indianapolis, right? <eos> Yes! I'm from Indiana.
I'm a fan of his brother Peyton. <eos> He is not on the Colts, though, is he? <eos> No, but he used to be.
Matt Stafford. <eos> No? Why not? <eos> He plays for Detroit.
Good choice.  He was a great receiver. <eos> What about you? <eos> I would say Joe Montana.
They each get a ring and a bonus. <eos> I figured about the bonus. How much do they get? <eos> I think it's a little over one hundred thousand.
They each got fifty three thousand dollars in this year's game. <eos> So about half? <eos> That sounds right.

The broncos. <eos> Why? <eos> Peyton Manning has a lot to prove.

Dan Marino is doing Weight Watchers. <eos> He is on Weight Watchers? <eos> He's now working for Weight Watchers.
Yes, but they never won a super bowl. <eos> Do you like the Steelers? <eos> No way. Got friends that do.
Preseason games will begin in August. <eos> Who is your favorite team? <eos> My favorite team is the Baltimore Ravens.
No, he's the greatest QB who had to resort to cheating. <eos> So you don't think he would've won the same without cheating? <eos> No I do not.
Really? I hadn't known that. <eos> I think its like 4 times? <eos> What, no way.
I think so too. I also like Taco Charlton from Michigan. <eos> Was he our first draft pick? <eos> Yes I think so. He is a defensive end I think.
Yes, silly question I know... <eos> Where did you watch the game? <eos> I was at my best friend's house...rooting for the Panthers.

Yeah, he always wore a suit and hat on the sidelines. <eos> Yeah, didn't he coach a long time? <eos> Yes he did, but kind of had a bad ending.
I think it was fitting for him. <eos> Remember the cheesy Noxzema commercial he did? <eos> That was pretty funny.
There's always some team that comes out of nowhere and surprised. <eos> Maybe Cleveland? <eos> The Browns?  Ha! not a chance.
Tebow is playing baseball these days. <eos> Who do you think improves the most this year? <eos> Maybe Washington?  They're due. So much wasted talent.
Yeah, I'm really into it. <eos> Do you do fantasy football as well? <eos> Sometimes.
They are one of my favorite teams. <eos> Who else do you like? <eos> I love the Titans.
Well.. it depends.. <eos> Depends on what? <eos> On who if Colin Kaepernick gets on a decent team.
On who if Colin Kaepernick gets on a decent team. <eos> Okay, not counting Kaepwenick, who do you think? <eos> I don't know, you go first.
I think Joe Flacco will get it. <eos> Seriously? Joe Flacco? <eos> Yeah man, the Ravens are legit.
I guess. <eos> Well? Who do you pick? <eos> Okay.. I think it will be Jameis Winston.
Okay.. I think it will be Jameis Winston. <eos> Jameis Winston? <eos> Yeah.

I like the Giants. <eos> Do you think Eli is over the hill? <eos> Eh, he's close but he's got plenty of weapons this year.
They deserve to be the preseason favorite, but there are questions. <eos> Like what? <eos> Whether Dax Prescott can take a further step this year.
I wasn't expecting THAT, that's for sure. <eos> Then what was it? <eos> Something else.
man i doubt it. <eos> why you say that? <eos> carlson palmer can't win the big game.
carolina beat them boys like they stole something. <eos> didn't they beat them by like five touchdowns? <eos> almost. they beat them by 34 points.

I think it's a great sport with some issues. <eos> What kind of issues? <eos> Mostly just with the referees and business model of it.
I agree but the issue is still their. <eos> Do you think it makes that much of a deal? <eos> I think it does.
Plus there are always questionable calls everygame. <eos> How many referees do you think are biased? <eos> I would guess at least 50% or more.
I would guess at least 50% or more. <eos> Do you really think it's that many? <eos> I do, referees are sports fans too they love the game.
Yes it was. <eos> Who were the coaches back then? <eos> Joe Gibbs for Washington.
I am so excited about the upcoming NFL season. <eos> Are you rooting for the Patriots? <eos> Yes I am.  I am a loyal fan.
Which has to be scary for the rest of the NFL. <eos> I know, how mad is Goodell right now? <eos> He has to be fuming.
I watched the whole thing until the end. <eos> Say, what was the final score anyway? <eos> The Giants scored 14 but the Steelers scored 24 points.

I like the 49ers. <eos> What about the Titans? <eos> They could do it.
They could do it. <eos> Do you think Marcus Mariota could get MVP? <eos> Nope, I think Brady will get it again.
Nope, I think Brady will get it again. <eos> Do you think about any team besides the Patriots? <eos> There isn't another team worth thinking about.
Not with 6 Super Bowl Rings. <eos> What about the Steelers, Cowboys, or 49ers? <eos> They still don't have 6 Superbowl Rings.
Hes the QB for the Falcons. <eos> Are you a Falcon´s fan? <eos> Not really I just like the player.
Not really I just like the player. <eos> And what is your favorite team? <eos> I really like the Raiders.
He also argued Tom Brady should make more than Steph Curry. <eos> I thought Brady was very well paid? <eos> He's on a two year contract for 41 million.
My Titans are going to be really good. <eos> Why you say that? <eos> Well, Mariota gives them a passing game.
I think it's how anyone can be good in any year. <eos> Who do you think will be good this year? <eos> Probably the Patriots again but there are some sleepers.
No too mediocre. <eos> Cowboys favored to win division right? <eos> I like the Eagles.
I like the Eagles. <eos> Why is that? <eos> Like the addition that made at wide receiver.
He hasn't performed well when the running game isn't supporting him. <eos> What about other divisional teams? <eos> Washington wasn't committal on Cousins as there franchise QB.
Elliot so good behind that line. <eos> Who is starting for Giants? <eos> No idea, probably a platoon situation.
Yes, but it was in January back then. <eos> I see. Who did they play back then? <eos> The Vikings.
Those terrible drops hint at it being mental honestly. <eos> What other quarterbacks are you looking into? <eos> I am intrigued by Goff from the Rams.
because they had the replay on again last night. <eos> what, it was on the n f l network? <eos> yeah. i watched it again.
yeah. i watched it again. <eos> why? <eos> nothing else was on.
yeah it is. <eos> who are you rooting for this season? <eos> i don't know. i just like watching good games each week.

I do actually. <eos> Is it your favorite team? <eos> It is indeed.
Sounds good to me. <eos> Why do you like them? <eos> One player got me to love them.
One player got me to love them. <eos> Who is that? <eos> Dwight Freeny.
Dwight Freeny. <eos> Why him, isn't he a defensive player too? <eos> Yes he is.
Yes he is. <eos> Why do you like him now? <eos> Right, he was a small defensive end pass rusher.
I don't like it. <eos> Why? <eos> It's a stupid money grab.
Exactly! LA just doesn't care. <eos> Then why keep trying? <eos> It's the second-biggest market in the country.
Yes, he is my favorite player. <eos> Why do you like him? <eos> I like watching videos of his unique training.
The Cowboys have a really good offensive line. <eos> Then why was Romo always injured? <eos> I think it's because some players are just injury prone.
I think it's because some players are just injury prone. <eos> What do you think about Dak Prescott? <eos> Hard to tell after 1 year.
two more weeks until training camp. <eos> dude, who cares about training camp? <eos> that means that the season is close behind.
Up until 2015 the NFL operated as an unincorporated nonprofit. <eos> What changed? <eos> The NFL drew criticism from the public, largely about taxes.
He's the one who hires the other two officers. <eos> The current commissioner is...who? <eos> I think its still Roger Goodell.
Maybe the Chiefs or Broncos. <eos> What about some NFC teams? <eos> I think the Giants may bounce back this year.
Defense wins championships for sure. <eos> What rookie is going to be good? <eos> I think McCaffey down in Carolina will be good.
Yes, I am a big fan. <eos> Who is your favorite team? <eos> I like the Chicago Bears.
Exactly, he has shown promise. <eos> Who do you think wins the AFC South? <eos> I like the Titans if Mariota stays healthy.
Yes he inspires me. <eos> How so? <eos> He demonstrates excellence and a committment to success like none other.
That's easy, the '72 Miami Dolphins. <eos> Oh come on, really? <eos> Yea, a perfect season warrants that I think.
I don't think that makes them the best team ever though. <eos> Why not, who else was better? <eos> Well the 18-1 Patriots for one.
Definitely. They need some good receivers too. <eos> With no Megatron, it's like... what's the point? <eos> Yeah. And the Bengals need someone to supplement Green.
I think they can grow though. <eos> Do you think they could ever be a superbowl team? <eos> Definitely maybe in another five years.
Definitely maybe in another five years. <eos> Think it will really take that long? <eos> I do, they're young and inexperienced.
I do, they're young and inexperienced. <eos> Can't Andrew Luck just carry the team? <eos> He's not experienced enough to do that yet.
He's not experienced enough to do that yet. <eos> Do you think Luck could be as good as manning? <eos> I don't think so Manning is just too good.
I don't think so Manning is just too good. <eos> Do you think he could be as good as say Favre? <eos> yes in skill, for sure.
I think they have a chance to be really good. <eos> Do you think they're better than last year? <eos> I think so, as long as Martavis Bryant comes back strong.
I think so, as long as Martavis Bryant comes back strong. <eos> So you think he can be a big difference maker? <eos> Definitely, they lacked that strong number two receiver last year.
Definitely, they lacked that strong number two receiver last year. <eos> He stretches the field too, doesn't he? <eos> Yeah, you have to respect his deep threat at all times.
Yeah, you have to respect his deep threat at all times. <eos> But how do they beat New England? <eos> They have to start playing man-to-man.
They have to start playing man-to-man. <eos> Do you think they have the players to do that? <eos> Probably not, but Brady is going to burn you either way.
Most likely not. <eos> How far do they go? <eos> They'll probably lose in the AFC Championship to New England, haha.
The Patriots are the favorite right now before the season. <eos> Do you think they will be able to repeat? <eos> It's hard to say.  The NFL anything can happen.
Not even close. They got blown out. <eos> Really, what was the score? <eos> Seahawks had 40 to the Panthers 7.
Seahawks had 40 to the Panthers 7. <eos> I didn't know that. How did Cam Newton do? <eos> He did okay. He threw for 182 passing yards.

Damn, man. <eos> What's up? <eos> Uhhhh, my car broke down.
Yes, the NFL pre-season games will kick off in August. <eos> Who is your favorite team? <eos> My favorite team is the Green bay packers.

The Patriots. <eos> Are you sure it wasn't the Seahawks? <eos> I'm absolutely sure.
I'm absolutely sure. <eos> I thought the Seahawks won? <eos> No, they were in the Superbowl though but lost.
Yeah it's been some months. <eos> Who do you think will win this year? <eos> I think it's going to be a repeat.
I think it's going to be a repeat. <eos> You think the Patriots will win again? <eos> I think so, you just can't beat them right now.
Fair enough. <eos> Who do you think will win? <eos> The Colts.
Not a bad choice I suppose. <eos> Why who would you pick? <eos> Im joining the AP train.
Im joining the AP train. <eos> Adrian Peterson? What has he done recently? <eos> Just you wait and see.
We had some of the best prospects that he fired. <eos> Brandon Marshall and Jay Cutler? <eos> Yes, those two.
He actually has guys to throw to. <eos> Who do you think will be his biggest target? <eos> I think Agoholor will have alot of improvement.
The SF 49ers and the Miami Dolphins. <eos> Oh wait, Joe Montana and Dan Marino? <eos> You got it.
Yeah, it was quite the shoot out as well. <eos> Was Marino a rookie that year? <eos> No, it was his second year.
No, it was his second year. <eos> Oh wow, who ended up winning? <eos> The 49ers by quite a bit.
Yeah, but I think it might be more Bellichick than Brady. <eos> Why? <eos> Well when Brady is hurt or suspended they continue to win.
My favorite NFL team is the Saints. <eos> What city is the Saints in? <eos> The Saints are in New Orleans.
Yeah, and I don't think Johnson has missed a game yet. <eos> Isn't he young though? <eos> Yeah, but I think that just adds to his attractiveness.
Hmm.. that's a really tough choice. <eos> Is it really? <eos> I guess not. I'm taking Pittsburgh.
Because they're good or because you love Big Ben. <eos> Can it be both? <eos> I guess so. I think it's the Cowboy's year.
And this year is going to be even better. <eos> How so? <eos> The cowboy's are going to be undefeated Superbowl champs.
His greatness.  His amazing running and catching ability. <eos> Alright, who is your favorite Dallas Coach? <eos> Tom Landry of course.
Tom Landry of course. <eos> What's your favorite Cowboy moment? <eos> The 95 Superbowl victory over Pittsburg.
The 95 Superbowl victory over Pittsburg. <eos> Have you ever gone to a Dallas game? <eos> No, but I did go see the Seahawks once.
No, but I did go see the Seahawks once. <eos> Oh, who did they play against? <eos> San Frisco and they beat them soundly.
San Frisco and they beat them soundly. <eos> Do you like Dallas's home or road uniforms better? <eos> I don't have a preference on that.
I don't have a preference on that. <eos> What team do you like the least? <eos> Pittsburg Steelers.  But the Raiders run a close second.
Pittsburg Steelers.  But the Raiders run a close second. <eos> Not any NFC East teams? <eos> Oh, yeah I'm not an Eagle fan.
Oh, yeah I'm not an Eagle fan. <eos> Who do you think will win the Superbowl this year? <eos> Dallas Cowboys.
Yeah. He reminds me of Reggie Bush. <eos> Is Reggie Bush still playing? <eos> Maybe? Last I checked, he played for the Lions.
Hello. <eos> Are you a football fan? <eos> Yeah sure am.
Yeah sure am. <eos> Do you like college or nfl, or both? <eos> I like both really.
I like both really. <eos> Do you like one more than the other? <eos> I like the pros a bit more I think.
I like the pros a bit more I think. <eos> Why is that? <eos> The skill level is a lot higher and I like that.
I have two reservations there. <eos> Oh, what are they? <eos> Number one is the cheating stuff.
Yeah, but that doesn't necessarily mean the whole organization is strong. <eos> OK, then what team would you pick? <eos> I'd go with the Steelers.
I just can't seem to get into football anymore. <eos> Why? What happened? <eos> I just miss watching Peyton Manning.
I don't think he's very good yet. <eos> What about Andrew Luck? <eos> He's good,He just can't stay healthy.
I'm thinking of trying to go to a game this year. <eos> Where would you go? <eos> I like the Bears, but I'd be open to anywhere really.
the raiders is my favorite. <eos> why do you like them so much? <eos> cause they are from fl.

i miss it a lot. <eos> would you ever go back? <eos> i would love to.
Wilson has been making them since 1941 at 4000 a day. <eos> Just for the NFL? <eos> Yes and one cowhide makes 10 footballs.
Yeah, it's been awhile. <eos> Do you remember who they played? <eos> The Cincinnati Bengals.
Anthony Munoz was the most famous. Not many after him. <eos> Oh he played offensive line right? <eos> Yes, that's him.
Terrible. <eos> You think? <eos> They're a terrible team and have been for a long time.
They're a terrible team and have been for a long time. <eos> You don't have faith in Trubisky? <eos> I don't have faith in the organization.
I don't have faith in the organization. <eos> Why not? <eos> For one, they can't retain talent. Marshall, Forte, Jeffrey, all gone.
Yeah, I have my favorite teams. <eos> With the teams, any idea how all of that works? <eos> Only because I'm self-taught. I've picked things up here and there.
Only because I'm self-taught. I've picked things up here and there. <eos> Tell me, how do the teams work? <eos> There are two conferences, with thirty-two clubs. Sixteen teams per conference.
So, you missed the Manning interview by Smith. <eos> Did Steven A interviewed Manning? <eos> Yeah, they had a sit down for about an hour.
Yeah, they had a sit down for about an hour. <eos> Did he talk about his injuries at all? <eos> He only mentioned his workout routine.
I take issue with Matt Ryan. <eos> Why's that? <eos> The Bucs usually beat the Falcons.
That's true, I think they beat them twice last year. <eos> Who do you think will win it all this year? <eos> I don't know, maybe the Steelers.
Well, I like the New England Patriots. <eos> They win a lot, but are they fair? <eos> Well, I think deflategate was overrated.
No, I don't think so. They're just good. <eos> What about a team out west? <eos> Well, I think the Denver Broncos are good.
Gilmore and Butler are going to dominate. <eos> Where's the Super Bowl this year? <eos> I think it's in Minnesota.
I think the Cardinals are the best NFL team. <eos> Really? Why is that? <eos> Blaine Gabbert is a great Quarterback.
They really are a great team. <eos> Do you think they will make the playoffs this year? <eos> I really hope they do.
Jay Ajayi, he helped them out a lot. <eos> Have your seen there schedule this year? <eos> Ya it is going to be a lot tougher.
Each team plays sixteen games in a season. <eos> When does the season usually begin in the fall? <eos> I think it is the weekend after Labor Day in September.
Cool. I can't wait for the start of the season. <eos> Who are you pulling for this year? <eos> I am liking the Panthers.
No, that doesnt help. <eos> Who do you think will win it all this year? <eos> I think the patriots are still contenders.
We can argue all day about that one. <eos> Okay, who do you think are the top tier receivers? <eos> Antonio Brown from the Steelers is top I think.
Four. <eos> Wow, when did they win their second one? <eos> 1976, for the 1975 season.
It would have to be the Miami Dolphins. <eos> Why is that your favorite team? <eos> Because they had a perfect season.
It almost was. <eos> By who? <eos> By the Patriots.
Well, they have Elliott.. <eos> So that's good? <eos> Yea he's a great player.
Well, he has been playing good.  However, time will tell. <eos> How do you think the Colts will do this year? <eos> I think they will end up 10-6.
I think they will end up 10-6. <eos> What did they finish at last year? <eos> I believe their record was 8 - 8.
Yeah sometimes I'm too busy to take much notice either. <eos> But you have an understanding of how it works? <eos> I guess so, its not too difficult.
Sometimes watching the NFL really bothers me. <eos> What? Why? <eos> Because of the lack of color options for the uniforms.
It's important to me! It really bothers me. <eos> What exactly bothers you about it? <eos> There are so many teams that share colors.
That risk is always there. <eos> True, but there's no need to maximize it right? <eos> I guess so, I just miss it.
Of course I do. <eos> What's your favorite team? <eos> The colts, I miss Peyton.
The colts, I miss Peyton. <eos> Peyton Manning? <eos> Yeah, he built that team I came to love.
Yeah, he built that team I came to love. <eos> Doesn't he still play? <eos> I think so, for the broncos.
Still love the team. <eos> Whose your quarterback now? <eos> Andrew Luck.
Andrew Luck. <eos> He's good, right? <eos> Yes, but he's no Manning.
Ummm... that's too generic. <eos> What else can we do? <eos> Not sure, depends.
Yes, I never miss them. <eos> Which network do you prefer to watch? <eos> I think the best network is Fox.
I think the best network is Fox. <eos> Which announcers do you prefer? <eos> I like Jimmy Johnson, I like his style.
I like Jimmy Johnson, I like his style. <eos> Which teams do you like? <eos> My favorite team is the Houston Texans.
I don't think soon. <eos> What about in the next fifteen years? <eos> I think so a few new teams will be added.
I think so a few new teams will be added. <eos> Think they will ever do a female NFL league? <eos> I hope so but it's doubtful.
Yeah, publicity could be a concern. <eos> Who do you think will win the superbowl? <eos> Indianapolis Colts.
Indianapolis Colts. <eos> That's surprising why? <eos> Andrew Luck is going to explode.
Yes, haven't played there for a long time. <eos> Who won the MVP for that game? <eos> Phil Simms.
Maybe. <eos> Who's backup in New York? <eos> Uhh...
Uhh... <eos> Geno Smith. Is Kaep better than Geno Smith? <eos> I'd say so, yeah.
And he'd be a great backup to Wilson in Seattle. <eos> They signed McCown, right? <eos> Who is terrible, and doesn't have the same game as Kaep.
Which translates to the Quarterback position. <eos> Yep. Is Teddy Bridgewater healthy? <eos> Bridgewater's out for all of 2017. And he's a free agent.
I will leave if you don't. <eos> You will leave if I don't stop watching the NFL? <eos> Yes, I will.
chip kelly ain't n f l material. <eos> exactly. but anyway, what does the eagles' schedule look like? <eos> they got the chiefs, seattle, the rams, the raiders.
yeah. the skins was good like two seasons ago. <eos> they won that division didn't they? <eos> i think so.
We won the AFC in 1984. <eos> Is that when you had Dan Marino? <eos> Yeah. He was MVP that year.
I love watching football highlights online. <eos> Why? what's the point of rewatching stuff? <eos> I get to see stuff from games I missed.
Yeah I know, but I love it. <eos> Who is your favorite player to watch? <eos> I don't know if I have a favorite.
I don't know if I have a favorite. <eos> Well who do you watch a lot? <eos> Hmmm.. I love watching William Perry.
Probably New England or Pittsburg. <eos> Who has the best passing game in the NFC? <eos> I gotta go with Drew Brees in New Orleans.
The kicker is the most important though. <eos> Yeah, who do you think has the best kicker? <eos> Vanderjagt doesn't miss.
I like the Rams. <eos> Did you like them before they moved to LA? <eos> Not really.
Yeah I like Jeff Fischer a lot.  Was too bad. <eos> Who is the new coach? <eos> I can't remember.
Yeah see that's very cool. <eos> I wonder if any of them still exist? <eos> See that would be interesting to  know as well.
Iron Mike. <eos> What position did Richard Dent play? <eos> Defense.
Defense. <eos> Who was the Chicago Bears 1985 Superbowl team's kicker? <eos> Kevin I can't think of his last name.
Salt and Pepper. <eos> What's the name of the dance the 1985 Superbowl winners created? <eos> The Chicago Bears Superbowl Shuffle.
Oh, wow. <eos> It's pretty dope, huh? <eos> Yeah, but it feels to me a little suspicious....
Yeah, but it feels to me a little suspicious.... <eos> Really? <eos> Yeah......
Yes, exactly. The Heisman isn't awarded in the NFL. <eos> I'm pretty sure the Heismas is for football, isn't it? <eos> It is, but for college football. NFL is the professional league.
Yes they do. The losing team as well. <eos> Are any of these cash prizes? <eos> No, I don't think cash is involved. Just the honor.
Yeah but maybe he'll come back rested and ready to go. <eos> Think Houston is going to be a lot better? <eos> If they get good play out of Savage maybe.
He is one of my favorite players of all time. <eos> Why do you like him? <eos> I love his intensity.
No, he's really a humble person off the field. <eos> What about on the field? <eos> He's a maniac all about destroying the other team.
My favorite player was Peyton Manning. <eos> Who was that? <eos> Peyton Manning was one of the all time great players.
Peyton Manning was one of the all time great players. <eos> What position did Peyton play? <eos> Peyton Manning played quarterback and set multiple records.
No, says the guy who's team got screwed by replacement referees. <eos> Did Steven A interviewed Manning? <eos> I guess they can improve once their head coach is gone.
Bob Griese is the big one. <eos> Oh yeah, he was a QB right? <eos> Right. Good one for his time too.
i know right. <eos> who you like this season? <eos> i don't know really. i always root for my eagles though.
Don't feel so bad, my team did bad to. <eos> What team is that? <eos> New Orlean Saints. They ended the season 7-9.
Not crazy about it as I am not a Patriot fan. <eos> You have to admit it was exciting right? <eos> Absolutely but, the wrong team won.
Absolutely but, the wrong team won. <eos> Why do you say that? <eos> Brady is a cry baby and Belecheck is a cheater.

Some of them really have personalities. <eos> Do you have any favorites? <eos> Jaxson de Ville is pretty entertaining.
I think Sourdough Sam is interesting because he changes his costumes. <eos> Isn't he the mascot for the 49ers? <eos> He is.
They're just so small and not that animated. <eos> Does every team have a mascot? <eos> No, some of them don't.
No, some of them don't. <eos> Any idea as to why? <eos> I really don't have a clue.
That makes sense. <eos> How about you? <eos> Mine has to be the Colts.
well i tend to go fore the more Payton Manning types. <eos> does that include Eli Manning? <eos> of course it does! that is one talented family.
or possibly the Texans. <eos> you think they will make it? <eos> there is always a time for anything.
I believe it was about 184 yards. <eos> What about Rodgers for Green Bay? <eos> I think Rodgers threw for about 209 yards.
I think Rodgers threw for about 209 yards. <eos> How many rushing yards did the Texans have? <eos> I think they had about 123 rushing yards.
I think they had about 123 rushing yards. <eos> What about the Packers. Did they do good in rushing? <eos> They did okay. They had 109 rushing yards.
Yes, and the Packers did better with receiving yards. <eos> Do you remember what the final score was? <eos> Yea, the Packers had 21 to the Texans' 13.
So that they can rest up. <eos> What do they need rest for? <eos> for injuries they get while playing.
I didn't think about that. <eos> Do you still think the off season is too long? <eos> Yes, but I see why it's necessary at least.
He is a smart runner. <eos> What about Drew Brees from New Orleans? <eos> I always liked Drew's game quick release and accurate passer.
Like some of the better ones he is also getting older. <eos> What about Big Ben in Pittsburgh? <eos> He's good but maybe in the top ten not top five.
He's good but maybe in the top ten not top five. <eos> Andrew Luck from Indianapolis is good and what about Cam Newon? <eos> Cam is too much of a show off to me.
well, my family is a huge fan of football. <eos> mine too! what team do they support? <eos> they really like the juguars.
oh, they love the dolphins. <eos> so you're from miami, i take it? <eos> yep, the whole family is.
Arizona might be a long shot and might make the playoffs. <eos> What about the other teams? <eos> The Rams are a mess I don't see anything happening there.
The Vikings were able to pull out the win. <eos> Oh really. What was the final score? <eos> The vikings won the game 25 to 16.
The vikings won the game 25 to 16. <eos> Who was Minnesota led by in passing yards? <eos> The quarterback, Shaun Hill threw for 236 yards.
The quarterback, Shaun Hill threw for 236 yards. <eos> How many did Mariota pass for on the Titans? <eos> Mariota threw for 271 yards.
Mariota threw for 271 yards. <eos> Also, did Mariota have any interceptions? <eos> Yes, he had 1 interception.
Yes, he had 1 interception. <eos> I figured that. How many rushing yards did Adrian Peterson get? <eos> He only had 31 rushing yards.
Yea, I was shocked that happened. <eos> Who was Minnesota's top receiver for the game? <eos> The top receiver was Stefon Diggs with 103 receiving yards.
True, but I think they are due. I really do. <eos> Did they get some awesome drafts picks or something? <eos> They got a few prospects and a few promising trades too.
Yup, He knew he was the man. <eos> So what time you want me there with wings? <eos> WINGS?  About 6.
Hello. <eos> Do you like watching the NFL? <eos> Yeah I do.
naw i don't think so. <eos> what you mean? <eos> they played the packers the eleventh game of the season.
Yea, the Rams appeared to be scared during the first half. <eos> Why do you say that? <eos> Because they didn't score any points at all.
Because they didn't score any points at all. <eos> Wow, not even a field goal? <eos> Nope, they could barely move the ball down the field.
Nope, they could barely move the ball down the field. <eos> How many yards did the Rams get from running the football? <eos> A whole 36 yards.
A whole 36 yards. <eos> That's sad. Did they do better with receiving? <eos> Somewhat, they had 161 receiving yards.
Somewhat, they had 161 receiving yards. <eos> How many yards did Brady pass for on the Patriots? <eos> Brady had 269 passing yards.
Brady had 269 passing yards. <eos> How did the Patriots do in running the football? <eos> They did much better than the Rams with 133 yards.
the deflating scandal, where they were caught deflating their footballs. <eos> no, which team was it? <eos> i believe it was the patriots.
yep, it was a huge thing years ago. <eos> how did the NFL catch onto them? <eos> probably heard a conversation about it or something.
When you win everyone wants to find something wrong with you. <eos> So you think they are going 16 and 0 I assume? <eos> I don't know about a sweep but 14 or 15.
There are. Some states have more than one team. <eos> Which state has the most? <eos> California has more teams than any other state.
California has more teams than any other state. <eos> How many teams does it have? <eos> It has four teams altogether.
It also has the Rams and the Chargers. <eos> What are some of the states that don't have teams? <eos> Alabama, Nevada, Oregon and Alaska.
No. They were a part of Intense Football League. <eos> Are they still around? <eos> No. They played their last game in 2010.
Ya that's taken out many a good quarterback. <eos> Have you been to the new stadium yet? <eos> Oh man that place is huge.
Eli Manning is nearly past his prime. <eos> Why won't Brady retire already? <eos> I know. He's achieved everything he can.
I doubt he ever will. The Giants won't make it back. <eos> Do you think Josh Gordon should be reinstated? <eos> No he's had too many chances and blown them all.
Okay. <eos> What did you wish for? <eos> I wished for a lot of things.
Same. <eos> Maybe, we can catch some fireflies after the game tonight? <eos> Perhaps, we shall take a look see.
Yeah, but the Redskins defense looks improved. <eos> I don't know man, the Redskins? Really? <eos> Kirk Cousins is for real.
Daniel Snyder has more money than sense. <eos> You're right. What's happening with Cousins? <eos> Kirk Cousins is a class act.
Kirk Cousins is a class act. <eos> I agree. did they ever get his contract straightened out? <eos> Not sure. July 15 is the deadline.
I agree, but I think there's drama on every team. <eos> In know, right? <eos> San Francisco didn't renew Colin Kaepernick.
The 1999 St. Louis Rams were one of my favorite teams. <eos> Who was on that team? <eos> They had Kurt Warner as quarterback.
They had Kurt Warner as quarterback. <eos> Who was the running back? <eos> It was Marshall Faulk.
It was called the greatest show on turf. <eos> Why the greatest show on turf? <eos> Because they played in a dome on astro turf.
They were a fun team to watch. <eos> Why were they so fun to watch? <eos> They would score all the time.  That offense was dominate.
Hi. <eos> Do you like the NFL? <eos> Yeah I love it.
Those teams are pretty cool as well. <eos> Are you exited about the new NFL season? <eos> Yeah I am hopefully my team does a great job.
I guess the pressure isn't as bad during regular season. <eos> You think they will go all the way this year? <eos> Don't know, but they looked pretty solid.
Ohh, yea football. <eos> So who are you going for this year? <eos> You know me die hard Cowboys fan.
A rookie with no good ankles. I'm not optimistic. <eos> What do you think about the real rookies, other than Trubisky? <eos> It's awfully small-school heavy.
It's awfully small-school heavy. <eos> You mean the TE, Shaheen? <eos> I was thinking about that tiny 3rd-down back they took later.
Yeah, went to a local sports bar to watch the game. <eos> You like Tom Brady? <eos> Yeah, he's a great player, but he doesn't seem too bright.
True, but that doesn't mean anything. <eos> Do you remember how they started out? <eos> Terribly if I recall correctly.
Are you excited for NFL football to start back. <eos> I am, when does pre-season start back again? <eos> NFL pre season games will start in August.
I love watching NFL games when it's snowing. <eos> Why snow? <eos> It makes everything more exciting.
It makes everything more exciting. <eos> How is snow exciting? <eos> It makes it more difficult. So the professionals make more mistakes.
I guess one special game is better than zero. <eos> Who do you think is the best team in the rain? <eos> That's an interesting question.
Prescott will have to play better than that next time. <eos> Yea, how many yards did he have? <eos> Prescott had 227 yards.
Prescott had 227 yards. <eos> What was his QB rating? <eos> It was only about 60.2.
It was really difficult for Elliott to get any rushing yards. <eos> How many yards did Elliot have anyway? <eos> He only had 51 yards on 20 carries.
Yep, and Dallas' top receiver only had 66 receiving yards. <eos> That's crazy. What was the final score if you remember? <eos> Giants beat my Cowboys 20 to 19. I'm sad now.
That offensive Jerry Jones built is insane. <eos> Aren't all five of the starters first round picks? <eos> I think they are and their backups are even pretty good.
Yeah. <eos> Do you watch college or nfl or both? <eos> I usually watch both.
Same here. <eos> Who is your favorite player right now in the NFL? <eos> Hmm tough question.
I like Odell Beckham a lot. <eos> The Giants wide receiver? <eos> Yeah that's him.
I like the seahawks quaterback a lot. <eos> Russell Wilson? <eos> Yeah that's him.
I don't know. It takes the fun out of it. <eos> Do you play fantasy football? <eos> No. That also takes the fun out of it.
True. <eos> What team would be your 2nd choice? <eos> The Lions of course, but that's just a pipe dream.....
I feel so bad for Seahawk fans, man. <eos> Why's that? <eos> Because of Marshawn Lynch.
You're just a hater. <eos> I thought you were a Patriots fan? <eos> I am.
I am. <eos> But now you're a Raiders fan? <eos> Yes sir.
Yes sir. <eos> How does that even work? <eos> I have enough love for all the teams.
Bob Griese. One of the most underrated QBs ever. <eos> I barely remember him. When did he stop playing? <eos> Around 1981 or so. Dan Marino took over after him.
Yes, I almost fell asleep right before halftime. <eos> What did Tannehill do for the Dolphins? <eos> He did okay. He had 226 passing yards.
They had 62 rushing yards as a team. <eos> Who was the leading rusher for Miami? <eos> Jay Ajayi had 61 rushing yards.
Hi.... <eos> How's it going? <eos> Good.
I overheard some complaints coming from some of the players themselves. <eos> About what? <eos> I'll tell you more, once we get out of this joint.
Yeah I like it as well. <eos> Who is your favorite player? <eos> I like Odell Beckham.
Yeah that was great. <eos> Didn't he autograph something during a game as well? <eos> Yeah he had a sharpie in his sock and signed something.
That guy is great. <eos> Who's your favorite player? <eos> I like Drew Brees a lot.
oh okay. so that means i was nine years old. <eos> that young? <eos> yep. i didn't understand it.
yep. i didn't understand it. <eos> so why did you watch it? <eos> because the home team eagles had made it to the championship.
my dad and all y uncles had a super bowl party. <eos> man who was the eagles' quarterback back then? <eos> ron jaworski.
It's even worse here, I promise. <eos> So will you be going to any games? <eos> I might.  It really depends on my finances.
I think the Seahawks will be tough, as usual. <eos> You are not worried about the Rams or niners? <eos> No way. I think they are trying to figure stuff out.
Possibly, they do have a great defense. <eos> Do you go to a lot of games? <eos> Not really, the tickets are so expensive.
Yeah he's exciting. <eos> Did you watch the draft? <eos> I actually went to it.  It was insane.
that's just gonna make him miss the action even more. <eos> do you think he's got anything left in the tank? <eos> yep. i think dallas will be sorry they let him go.
naw, that young bull is the truth. <eos> you talking about prescott? <eos> yeah.
Dan Marino is a good example of that. <eos> Isn't he a former quarterback for the Miami Dolphins? <eos> Yes. He played 17 seasons for them.
I know of another reason. <eos> What's that? <eos> Having too many kids.
The Miami Dolphins. <eos> Why do you think so? <eos> They have a chance to beat every team.
They have a promising quarterback and running back. <eos> And who are they? <eos> Quarterback Ryan Tanehill and running back Jay Ajayi.
Quarterback Ryan Tanehill and running back Jay Ajayi. <eos> Is that all? <eos> They have a decent offensive line.
They have a decent offensive line. <eos> What about their defense? <eos> It can be better but it does have many play makers.
It can be better but it does have many play makers. <eos> Such as? <eos> Ndamukong Suh and Cameron Wake.
Huh? They lost several key defensive players over the season. <eos> Like who? <eos> Nolan Carroll and Barry Church are two that come to mind.
Not sure, don't have anyone in mind. <eos> What about the Dolphins? <eos> The Dolphins are okay.
Yeah i can't wait. <eos> Do you know who they are up against? <eos> I think the NE Pats.
listen, it's definetely real, or else it wouldn't be a curse. <eos> so what does it entail? <eos> well, there's several parts to the curse.
well, there's several parts to the curse. <eos> the first i'm guessing is people who have ever won? <eos> yep, teams that continously get to the superbowl but always lose.
I think right now it's Tom Brady. <eos> Do you think he's better than Joe Montana? <eos> Brady has won more Super Bowls than Montana.
Brady has won more Super Bowls than Montana. <eos> How many Super Bowls did Montana win? <eos> Joe Montana won 4 Super Bowls.
Joe Montana won 4 Super Bowls. <eos> How many has Brady won? <eos> Tom has won 5.
Tom has won 5. <eos> What about Terry Bradshaw? <eos> Terry Bradshaw won 4 Super Bowls.
I think Joe is better than Brady. <eos> Why is that? <eos> Joe just seemed to never lose his cool.
Tough to say, that was a brutal loss. <eos> You think they'll be impacted by the Super Bowl loss? <eos> I don't see how they are not.
I don't see how they are not. <eos> What about the Patriots? <eos> They're getting old but you can't count them out.
They're getting old but you can't count them out. <eos> You think this will be Brady's last season? <eos> Not sure but I would not be shocked.
Not sure but I would not be shocked. <eos> You like any sleeper teams this year? <eos> I don't think you can ever sleep on the Giants.
Big time prima donna. <eos> Alright, final prediction for the Super Bowl? <eos> I like the Steelers and the Giants.
Gostkowski is a kicker. <eos> Right, what position does Gronkowski play? <eos> Linebacker, if I remember right.
Linebacker, if I remember right. <eos> I thought he was a tight end? <eos> He played as quarterback in college.
He played as quarterback in college. <eos> Which college was that? <eos> Notre Dame.
Not as good as North Carolina. <eos> Whose the NC coach? <eos> I don't keep track of college football too closely.
Some professional football players have had some really strange names. <eos> Like Ben Gay? <eos> Yes, the former running back for the Cleveland Browns.
I think one of the weirdest was Fair Hooker. <eos> Seriously, someone named their kid that? <eos> They did. He drafted by the Cleveland Browns.
They did. He drafted by the Cleveland Browns. <eos> Have you heard of Captain Munnerlyn? <eos> No I haven't.
Well, he's of Samoan heritage. <eos> Maybe that's a normal name in that culture? <eos> Maybe. Here's one more. Lawyer Milloy.
Yeah, they just choked at the end there. <eos> Matt Ryan still their quarterback? <eos> Yeah, him and Schaub. Both Matts though.
Yeah, the season starts September 7th I think. <eos> Is it a home game? <eos> Yes for the 49ers.
He has one of the highest winning percentages in the NFL. <eos> Or what about Ted Thompson retiring? <eos> I would love if they pick up the old Chiefs GM.
I would love if they pick up the old Chiefs GM. <eos> Are you going to any games? <eos> Maybe a preseason game.
Yes, very hard to watch the replay. <eos> Did he ever play again? <eos> I don't remember for sure, if he did it wasn't long.
I would say Lawerence Taylor from the New York Giants. <eos> Why do you like him? <eos> I love the way he played.  He was vicious.
He made the linebacker position more of a complete position. <eos> Who is your current favorite player? <eos> I like watching Le'Veon Bell of the Pittsburgh Steelers.
Oh yeah that's a funny movie. <eos> What other football related things do you like to do? <eos> I'm in a fantasy football league.
I'm in a fantasy football league. <eos> Oh really? Do you win money with that? <eos> No it's more like bragging rights.
No it's more like bragging rights. <eos> Oh ok so do you ever win? <eos> I won a lot this past year. I was pretty lucky.
I'm a big fan have been since I was a kid. <eos> Did you ever play some football yourself? <eos> I played some high school varsity but that's it.
I can't agree more. <eos> Want to watch the Patriots play this weekend? <eos> Sure.
Every sunday. <eos> Do you like Tom Brady? <eos> Yep, he plays for my favorite team.
I think so. <eos> Why? <eos> Not many teams that can go toe to toe with them.
That's true. <eos> Who do you think can beat them? <eos> Broncos.
Broncos. <eos> Why them? <eos> One guy, Peyton Manning.
Yeah I love it. <eos> Do you watch a lot of NFL games? <eos> Yeah I do.
Yeah that was pretty awful. <eos> What happened? <eos> Man I have no idea.  They were up so big.
The Giants. <eos> Who did they play against? <eos> Buffalo.
Buffalo. <eos> And where did they play? <eos> Tampa.
Hmmm, that's a really long time ago. <eos> Can't do it? <eos> I didn't say that. Dallas beat Miami in New Orleans.
Yes, the Dolphins. <eos> Oh, so they won back-to-back? <eos> Yes, that is correct.
They are not a good team. <eos> So making the playoffs means you're not a good team? <eos> No, losing in the first round after a wildcard berth does.
Still last, probably. <eos> Which team do you expect to win? <eos> I think Seattle is a lock.
EJ is playing with some real vets. <eos> I absolutely agree. How long is Manning out? <eos> I think he's coming back for the 5th game.
Brady is not too far down on that list. <eos> Did he talk about his injuries at all? <eos> He only mentioned his workout routine.
Sure did. <eos> What team does he play for? <eos> Broncos, he played for the colts for over a decade though.
Yeah, he probably only has a couple years left to play. <eos> You a fan of his? <eos> I'm a big fan.
That makes sense. <eos> Do you have a favorite team? <eos> The patriots.
The patriots. <eos> Why? <eos> I'm a fan of Tom Bradys.
They are the Washington Redskins. <eos> What city are they located in? <eos> They are based in Washington D.C.
Cam Newton is a tough player. <eos> Do you think the Bucs have any chance? <eos> With picking up Desean Jackson I think their offense improves.
I don't either. <eos> Do you watch much of preseason? <eos> I usually don't.
I can't agree with that. Now we have reports about Sherman. <eos> Weren't they actually actively trying to trade him? <eos> I think the Seahawks admitted to dangling him.
I am and pre-season should be starting soon thankfully. <eos> What do you think of the Patriots? <eos> I must admit, I am not a fan of the Patriots.
probably not, to be honest, but that's not really their fault. <eos> yeah, people who are drafted are relatively young, aren't they? <eos> yeah, i think a lot are between 18 and 25.
yeah, but not a lot, only the best. <eos> yep, why do you think they draft so young? <eos> probably to keep people around the longest.
I know. I'm so happy it's almost back. <eos> Who do you think is gonna win it all this year? <eos> Oh, man. You know I'm going with the Falcons again.
Oh that makes sense. <eos> Who do you follow now? <eos> I've become something of a cheesehead, among other teams.
I've become something of a cheesehead, among other teams. <eos> The Packers? <eos> Yep.
Yep. <eos> Why them? <eos> Well, they're pretty close.
Well, they're pretty close. <eos> Geographically? <eos> Yeah, I guess.
Yeah, I guess. <eos> Aren't the Chiefs closer? <eos> Yes, but I can't stand them.
Yes, but I can't stand them. <eos> I guess that makes sense. Who else do you follow? <eos> I've always liked the Broncos.
Doing well. Just doing some things on my ESPN app. <eos> Who are you watching? <eos> The Eagles.
Not much else. <eos> What about the Rams? <eos> Nope.
Nope. <eos> The Lions? <eos> Nope.
We've got to catch some games this year. <eos> Will the little woman let you out of the house? <eos> Well, Sunday for sure. You know we play pool on Mondays.
Yeah sure I watch a lot of games. <eos> Nice, what team do you like? <eos> I'm a bengals fan.
Oh okay. <eos> What about you? <eos> I like the Titans.
I like the Titans. <eos> You from Nashville? <eos> I grew up there, but don't live there any more.
Oh I see. <eos> What about you, you in the Cincy area? <eos> Yeah that's where I live.
Yeah that's where I live. <eos> Do you have a favorite player? <eos> I like Andy Dalton a lot.
Nope, 10 points in the first quarter and that was it. <eos> Wow, 2nd straight loss for John Elway? <eos> Yes, and Dan Reeves.
Baseball is too slow-paced for me. <eos> What do you know about sports history? <eos> I know the backgrounds of football and basketball.
Not without Manning. Probably not, anyway. <eos> How about the Seahawks? <eos> Yeah, maybe. They're a great team.
They won the Super Bowl a few years ago. <eos> Who did they beat in that game? <eos> Denver. The Broncos.
The first game is September 7th. <eos> Who is playing opening night? <eos> New England is playing Kansas City I believe.
I hate the Cowboys. Can't agree. <eos> Who do you think, then? <eos> Has to be some older generation guy probably.
The LA Rams. They will have a new coach this year. <eos> Whoa, a new coach? What happened to Jeff Fisher? <eos> He was fired, They were 31-45 in his time with them.
I am going to a buddy's house to celebrate the win. <eos> Is your buddy a Seahawk's fan? <eos> Yeah, he will like anyone whose a Seahawk Fan.
OK. That works for me. <eos> Do you want to do dinner or snacks? <eos> I will bring pizza.
Thank you sweetie. <eos> Are you ready to see me in my element? <eos> Yes, I love seeing you excited.
That's exactly why I like him. <eos> Okay, well, who is your second favorite? <eos> Probably Julio Jones.
I guess those are okay players to have as your favorite. <eos> What about you? Who is your favorite? <eos> My favorite is obviously Antonio Brown.
Well I think he was still pretty good with them. <eos> How many Super Bowls did he win in total? <eos> I think just that one.
I also think that the Jets will continue to be mediocre. <eos> Do you think that the Chargers will bounce back? <eos> Perhaps, but they need to overhaul their roster.
Perhaps, but they need to overhaul their roster. <eos> We will see, what about the Bears? <eos> The Bears will get marginally better, but who knows.
Well, I'll be interested to watch Amari Cooper this season. <eos> Even though the team is moving to Las Vegas? <eos> Yeah, even so. I'll still be watching.
Oh, I think Dereck Carr will be phenomenal this year. <eos> Do you see anybody exemplary in the backfield? <eos> Yeah I see a few players.
Yeah I see a few players. <eos> And who might they be? <eos> Khalil Mack for one.
I don't know, I guess it seems to mean more. <eos> Like what school spirit or something? <eos> I guess.
I can sort of see that. <eos> Why do you like the NFL? <eos> I like how good the players are.
He's a game changer. <eos> What about you? Who would you pick? <eos> For me, it has to be a quarterback.
Usually, running backs decline by that age. <eos> What team is he on? <eos> He plays for the Raiders now.
Thanks, I appreciate you saying that. <eos> I take it you're out for fantasy this year too? <eos> Yeah man, I think that's for the best.
Yes, with the risk of injury being the highest. <eos> Hardest position in the NFL? <eos> CB by far with the way these receivers are.
CB by far with the way these receivers are. <eos> Whos going to win the superbowl? <eos> I hate them, but New England.
I hate them, but New England. <eos> Who's the best kicker right now? <eos> Brad Wing.
Absolutely! I love the success Tyrod Taylor is having with Buffalo. <eos> He's such a great kid. Any others? <eos> Sure, the Fuller brothers are exceptional.
Logan Thomas plays tight end. <eos> And who else? <eos> Nigel Williams plays defensive end.
I think Lynch is ready to step up, man. <eos> Is he even the starter, officially? <eos> No, but he's been looking good in camp.
I think he's a good back-up QB. <eos> What makes you think that Lynch is better than him? <eos> I don't know. Just something about the way his mechanics are.
Hi. <eos> We're supposed to talk about the NFL? <eos> Yeah that's right.
Yeah that's right. <eos> Do you have a team that you like? <eos> I like the Jets and the Panthers.
Yes, it is. <eos> How much is the NFL trophy worth? <eos> The dollar value of the trophy is about 25 thousand.
He's making $900,000. <eos> Thats underpaid!? <eos> Well compared to others in his position.
I wish the rules were like in the 70s. <eos> Oh you mean where you could basically kill someone? <eos> It was a mans game back then.
Only Fabre could bring that to every play. <eos> Didn't he play with a concussion? <eos> Multiple times.
That would be nice. <eos> Do you think Rodgers will ever be as good as him? <eos> Maybe with enough time.
I know, I'm excited. <eos> Who is your team? <eos> I like the Raiders.
No, I love to gamble, so it works out. <eos> Really? But don't you think they will lose their edge? <eos> Nope, I think it's pretty static.
Nope, I think it's pretty static. <eos> Who is your favorite player? <eos> I love Derek Carr.
Yeah, I like his chances with our new receivers. <eos> Do you think they'll be a playoff team? <eos> Yes, I think we'll win about 11 games this year.
Yes, I think we'll win about 11 games this year. <eos> Hmm.. and who are you worried about? <eos> No one really, I think we're capable of beating anyone.
The Seahawks won the NFC West in 2016. <eos> How did the Cardinals do? <eos> They under performed and did not even make the playoffs.
They lost one good lineman but have shored that position up. <eos> What about corner back? <eos> The added some depth there and should be much better.
Hi. <eos> Do you like football? <eos> Yeah sure do.  Big NFL fan.
Oh cool. <eos> How about you? <eos> Yeah I like it a lot as well.
Yeah I like it a lot as well. <eos> Do you have a favorite team? <eos> Not really, I just like watching exciting games.
Oh okay. <eos> What about you? <eos> I like the Giants.
No, I'm just saying. <eos> Just saying what? <eos> It requires help. A quarterback can't do it all by himself.
It will be here in less than a month. <eos> I know, who do you like this year? <eos> You know me, I am a Patriot's fan all the way.
I think it is very important, as important as skills. <eos> What part of the team intrigues you? <eos> For the Titans, it would be their offense.
I would be pretty mad if i lived in Oakland. <eos> Do you think that the Patriots will repeat as champions? <eos> I do not know, but I would not be surprised.
The spike was the first touchdown celebration. <eos> Who invented it? <eos> Honer Jones way back in 1965.
I think Rivers. But it's close between him and Eli. <eos> No love for Ben? <eos> He's great but gets hurt too much.
Yeah. <eos> What if someone paid the Pats to do that? <eos> NO WAY. They debunked that stuff a long time ago.
Uhhhh, I don't think there's anyone behind the incident. <eos> Dude, why you gotta be so stubborn sometimes? <eos> Well, that's me, man.
Well, that's me, man. <eos> Whatever, so who do you think is an alright thrower? <eos> Kaepernick's pretty good.
I don't know man, it wouldn't even be the same. <eos> What? why not? <eos> Because Beast Mode isn't on the team anymore.
I have loved pop music since I was pretty young. <eos> I have to! Who was your favorite growing up? <eos> I loved listening to Britney Spears music when I was 11.
Yeah I love pop music. <eos> Who is your favorite? <eos> I like christina aguliera.
I like christina aguliera. <eos> I like her too! What song is your favorite? <eos> I like the song walk away.
She had some good hits. <eos> Is Adele considered a pop artist? <eos> I don't know- she is more soulful.
Tough to say between Bruno Mars and Beyonce. <eos> How about Nicki Minaj? <eos> I would say shes more of a rapper.
Yes for sure. Not all singers have that. <eos> What about Rihanna? <eos> Yes she has many songs I like.
I really like Backstreet's Back. <eos> Really? Why that song? <eos> I always thought Nick Carter's line about being sexual was hilarious.
Yeah its really great. Wish there were more. <eos> So who do you like? <eos> Go Gos, Bangles, and Pussy Riot.
That song was just so good. <eos> Do you think Destinys Child could reunite? <eos> They could and it would make a ton of money.
Yes. She was a pop singer for a long time. <eos> That sounds good. What are her songs about? <eos> Mostly love. The melodies are really good.
Her album Control had a few hits. <eos> What Have You Done For Me Lately was on that, right? <eos> Yes. My friend had the cassette.
I really like Taylor Swift. <eos> What song by her do you like? <eos> I like the song trouble.
I saw her in concert once. <eos> Oh really? What tour? <eos> Fearless.
My daughter is a Demi Lovato fan. <eos> Wasn't she on a kids' show? <eos> Yes, she was on Barney.
Yes, she was on Barney. <eos> Cool.  What's one of her big hits? <eos> This is Me.
This is Me. <eos> Right.  What album was it in? <eos> Don't Forget.
Nowadays she does. <eos> But she didnt always? <eos> When she was in No Doubt, she did not.
When she was in No Doubt, she did not. <eos> What genre would you consider that? <eos> I guess rock.
I guess rock. <eos> So she broke away from them? <eos> Yeah she still performs songs like Dont Speak.
Yeah she still performs songs like Dont Speak. <eos> But no longer tours with them? <eos> No, plus shes on that NBC show for singers.
Oh gosh yes! 7-8 times. <eos> Can you believe they have 11 kids between them? <eos> Are you serious?!?!?! I had no clue they had that many.
I'm not the biggest fan. <eos> Why not? <eos> Well, I recognize his talent for sure, he's a good singer.
Well, I recognize his talent for sure, he's a good singer. <eos> But..? <eos> But his melodies don't work. They jump around too much.
Apparently she has written a bunch of songs for other artists. <eos> Like what and who? <eos> Justin Bieber's Sorry for one.
Yea,me too. <eos> How about,Teenage Dreams? <eos> I like that too.
I like that too. <eos> Do you like firework? <eos> Yes,another good one.
I like Work by Rhianna. <eos> Have you heard Ed Sheeran's new song Shape of You? <eos> Yes, I love how easy it is to dance to.

I mean that's true. <eos> Who would you pick? <eos> Definitely Notorious B.I.G. I love Juicy and Hypnotize.

We'll save yourself the trouble. <eos> Is it really that bad? <eos> It's awful and can't remotely compare to their classic albums.
I heard a Rush song on the radio today. <eos> Yeah, which one? <eos> Tom Sawyer.

Of course. Every move was calculated. <eos> Did you like the love story? <eos> Yes, Han and the princess were great together.
Very much so.  I've seen all the trailers. <eos> Do you think they will have all the old characters? <eos> I know it will have Luke Skywalker, Finn and Rey.
I was a little disappointed. <eos> What disappointed you? <eos> It was a little dull for me.
Yeah I thought it wasnt that great. <eos> Why do you say that? <eos> I think the acting was lacking.
Maybe, but its the truth. <eos> Did you want more of the original cast? <eos> No I think they all showed up right.
No I think they all showed up right. <eos> How about James Earl Jones? <eos> Now that would have been comedy.
Well I didn't really like Force Awakens. <eos> What! How couldn't you. It was so good? <eos> I guess I've never been a die hard Star Wars fan.
I guess the 3rd one; I forgot what it's called. <eos> Why that one? <eos> Because it was dark and had some tense moments.
No, wow you're asking a lot. There are so many. <eos> How far did you get in the series? <eos> I only got to the fourth movie, The Phantom Menace.
That was a great movie. <eos> Yes, it was. Are all the movies over two hours long? <eos> Most of them, yes. Except I think The Clone Wars.
Yes... <eos> Remeber in the cantina? <eos> Oh, yeah! Greedo for sure.
I like C-3PO. <eos> He is really good. Which movie is he the best in? <eos> He is awesome in the first movie.
Yeah, they really developed his character well. <eos> Do you like R2-D2 as well? <eos> Yes, he is really funny.
Yes, he is really funny. <eos> Did you like him in the prequels? <eos> No, it was just a little strange to see him there.
I did want to look like Princess Leia, though. <eos> What about her appealed to you? <eos> She was beautiful AND strong AND capable.
Yeah, the first one developed his character a lot more. <eos> Did you like him in Return of the Jedi? <eos> Yes, but I think they should have killed him off.
Campiness in Star Wars movies is underrated. <eos> Who is your favorite character? <eos> I would say, Luke Skywalker.
Yes, they were super cute. <eos> What was your favorite scene? <eos> I loved it when Leia kills Jabba the Hut.
Well, look at who is directing. <eos> Who? <eos> J.J. Abrams.
I just saw Attack of the Clones again. <eos> Did you like that one? <eos> It wasn't too bad.  Loved Padmé Amidala.
I liked the battle, though. <eos> Me too.  What else did you like? <eos> I like the marriage at the end of the movie.
Those were pretty neat special effects for the time. <eos> Did George Lucas direct that one? <eos> I think he did.
Debbie and Harrison looked great.  Mark aged. <eos> Too bad.  Everyone survive? <eos> No, they kill off Han Solo.
A lot. <eos> But how many exactly? <eos> I've seen all 7 and the offshoot, Rogue 1.
I've seen all 7 and the offshoot, Rogue 1. <eos> Did you have a favorite one? <eos> My favorite was Return of the Jedi.
I did, made me cry though. <eos> Oh, when Han died? <eos> Yes, the whole scene. Him meeting his son again.
Yes, the movie works much better without him. <eos> What is your favorite scene in the first movie? <eos> The R2-D2 scene where he gets captured.
I agree.  Nothing much happens in the movie. <eos> What was your favorite scene? <eos> When they froze Han Solo.
I thought Rey was pretty great. <eos> Did you like BB8? <eos> He was fun but he's no R2D2.
I think Padmé Amidala was once again, hot. <eos> Agreed.  What else did you like? <eos> I liked when Anakin killed the kids.
My favorite quote was by Admiral Ackbar. <eos> What movie did this take place in? <eos> I think it happened in the Return of the Jedi.
What do you think of the Star Wars prequels. <eos> Episodes one through Three, or the chronological sequels? <eos> A bit confusing, I know, but Episode one through Three.
Who would win if Luke fough Darth Maul. <eos> Is this legends canon or Disney? <eos> It's Disney canon.
I thought the same. <eos> Who was your favorite character? <eos> I liked the blind asian monk guy.
Haha, but his buddy covered his back. <eos> Yeah that's true. But what was their backstory? <eos> It wasn't really mentioned.
I think I saw three versions of Return of the Jedi. <eos> Really? What were they? <eos> The first one was the original, released in 1983.
The last time I saw this there was one ther change. <eos> Which was? <eos> They replaced Ray Milland standing with Yoda and Obi-wan.
i want to build a Star Wars model. <eos> Which once? <eos> The Lego Death Star.
Yes, some helmets, masks, etc. <eos> What about a light saber? <eos> A few of those too.
It was a great, eye opening movie. <eos> Who was your favorite actor or actress? <eos> I loved Alec Guinness.  He gave a dignified performance.
I loved Alec Guinness.  He gave a dignified performance. <eos> Who's he? <eos> He was a great British actor.
He was a great British actor. <eos> Did you like anyone else? <eos> I've loved Harrison Ford ever since he was in American Graffiti.
I agree. I liked 3PO way better. <eos> Did you like the new film? <eos> No, I thought it was very boring.
I know.  And so soon after her mom died. <eos> Did you ever try the Princess Leia hairstyle? <eos> I'm a dude.  My hair isn't long enough.
Only if they already have the footage. <eos> Why do you say that? <eos> The Fisher Estate won't allow it.
The Fisher Estate won't allow it. <eos> Huh? <eos> They won't allow any electronic recreation of her image.
I didn't like the kid  who played Anakin. <eos> Why not? <eos> He was a little too cute for me.
He was a little too cute for me. <eos> I see what you mean.  Who did you like? <eos> Natalie Portman was super hot, even in makeup.
I don't know.  It looks like a piece of junk. <eos> Are you quoting Han Solo? <eos> I'm trying to.
I just Saw the new Star Wars movie Rogue One. <eos> How did you like it? <eos> I loved it and was glad to buy it on DVD.
Yeah, but it'd be cool. <eos> Are you going to see it in the theater? <eos> Probably.
I just saw Rogue One. <eos> Neat!  Any of the old crew show up? <eos> No, all new characters.
By what? Good film. <eos> I liked it, but was the force sleeping before? <eos> No, it just means that a new Jedi had emerged.
Oh man, it was something that happened in The Force Awakens. <eos> What happened in the movie that left you in disbelief? <eos> It was when the Imperial Fleet fired up their weapon.
JJ Abrams. <eos> Why did you like him? <eos> Because I think the movies he directs are very well done.
Because I think the movies he directs are very well done. <eos> What did you think of George Lucas? <eos> He was okay, but I'm not a fan of the prequels.
My most favorite Star Wars side character is definitely C-3PO. <eos> Why is C-3PO your favorite character? <eos> I find C-3PO to be a great comic relief character.
I find C-3PO to be a great comic relief character. <eos> What makes C-3PO a great comic relief character? <eos> It is C-3PO's interactions with everyone that makes me laugh.
I just saw Return of the Jedi. <eos> Which version did you see? <eos> The 1997 version.
The 1997 version. <eos> Did you notice any differences? <eos> The song in Jabba's palace was changed.
Very. <eos> When is it coming out? <eos> December 2017.
Not really. I had no idea what the bad guys wanted. <eos> Did you think Darth Maul was cool? <eos> Yes, I loved his paint.
Yes, I loved his paint. <eos> What was the most creative part of the movie? <eos> I liked the Pod racing scene.
I saw The Phantom Menace when it came out. <eos> Really? What was your favorite character? <eos> I really liked Darth Maul, I thought his lightsabre was cool.
I know, he wasn't very good... <eos> Remember all the times he said "Yippee!"? <eos> I paid more attention to that annoying Jar Jar.
to be honest, i like annakins scenes better. <eos> okay, thats fine...but whats your favorite vader scene? <eos> probably aganst luke.
The trailer seems to share imagery with that movie. <eos> Oh, did you mean the AT-AT battle portion? <eos> Yeah. That's one part.
Yeah, the Ewok home world. <eos> How bout next favorite? <eos> Probably Degoba.
Yeah I did. <eos> Did  you like it? <eos> Yeah I really did.
There were a few before Rogue One. <eos> There were? <eos> Well, maybe just one.
Well, maybe just one. <eos> Which one? <eos> I remeber a movie based on Ewoks.
I was so excited about the first new Star Wars Movie. <eos> Why is that? <eos> There were several reasons, not just one.
Yes, I liked it very much. <eos> Who was your favorite character? <eos> Jyn Erso was probably my favorite.
Jyn Erso was probably my favorite. <eos> Who played that character? <eos> She was played by Felicity Jones.
Because you get to see the birth of darth vader. <eos> Is he your favorite character? <eos> Yes, i have always liked that character since the original trilogy.
You tell me. It was Kanjiklub. <eos> What's wrong with them? <eos> It's the name. It sounds like kaiju club.
Oh one of the new ones interesting. <eos> You disagree? <eos> I thought it was good but not my favorite.
that is true. it was kinda boring. <eos> did you like kylo ren at least? <eos> he is nothing like the force that was vader.
he is nothing like the force that was vader. <eos> he did not do it for you, huh? <eos> he was just an immature child with power.
I'm gonna say BB. <eos> Why? <eos> He just added a lot more comic releife.
I'm a Hon Solo kind of a guy. <eos> A blaster then? <eos> Of course. I'll bet you're more of a Luke kinda fellow.
I think thats one of the biggest flaws as well. <eos> So whats your favorite movie? <eos> I loved the Phantom Menace, I thought it was pretty cool.
Yes, I watch the movies to see the specail effects. <eos> Do you perfer the old movies or the new movies? <eos> I like both sets of movies.
There's something odd about the Star Wars universe. <eos> There's a trillion odd things. What bugs you now? <eos> Lightsabers.
No, not that--that's the science fantasy portion. <eos> Then, when is it? <eos> That they have to press a button to activate the lightsaber.
Hi. <eos> Looking forward to more star wars movies? <eos> Yeah sure am.
Yeah sure am. <eos> Any one in particular? <eos> I'm looking forward to the Han Solo remake.
Awesome idea, maybe you should get hired by Disney. <eos> What about for a Yoda story? <eos> Take a look back at centuries of development.
Star Wars the clone wars. <eos> Why is that? <eos> Well I just did not like the plot, just felt forced.
Hi there. <eos> You like star wars? <eos> Yes, I love star wars.
It's fun to speculate though. <eos> Yes, it is.  Maybe she is Luke's daughter? <eos> Possibly, that would be too obvious though.
Me to. I cried when I thought Cassian had died. <eos> Which one is Cassian again? <eos> The actor was Diego Luna.
The X wing. <eos> That one is cool. What do you like about it? <eos> It seems like it might actually fly.
I like the battles. <eos> Whos your favorite character? <eos> Got to be Luke.
Ha, flippy crap, nice. I don't like that one. <eos> Why not? <eos> It's too rehearsed: fighting doesn't work that way.
Hi there. <eos> Do you like Star Wars? <eos> Sure.
Sure. <eos> Do you have a favorite movie? <eos> I really like the most recent one that came out.
I really like the most recent one that came out. <eos> Rogue One? <eos> Yeah that's the one.
Oh interesting. <eos> What about you? <eos> I like Luke.
So Palpatine thinks. Or, so he WANTS us to think. <eos> Maybe they're in cahoots? And he'll take over with Palpatine dead? <eos> Maybe. I have a good idea.
That's a tough question, I've gotta go with Darth Vader. <eos> Why is Darth Vader your favorite? <eos> Because he's completely amazing and powerful.
Because he's completely amazing and powerful. <eos> Any other reason why you like him? <eos> Well he has such an amazing back story.
Hello. <eos> Do you know they're working on more star wars movies? <eos> Oh yeah, I'm excited.
Yeah that's right. <eos> What happened to george lucas? <eos> He sold it to disney for a few billion.
I like it. <eos> Have you seen any of the movies? <eos> Yeah, I like Darth Vader.
Yeah, that seemed overkill. <eos> Yours? <eos> Padmé. Died of a broken heart. What a load of waffles.
Cool same here. <eos> What is your favorite movie? <eos> I like Empire Strikes Back.
That's a classic. <eos> Yeah I love it.  What about you? <eos> I like Return of the Jedi.
Yeah and a lot of the characters were changed as well. <eos> What did you like about the updates? <eos> Nothing really. I thought it made the film worse.
I wish I had a light saber. <eos> Like the one in the STAR WARS movies? <eos> Yes. They could cut through anything.
he just WANTS to be the new vader. <eos> You're saying he can't be? <eos> he's not as ruthless or as intelligent.
Yes, I have but only once. <eos> What was your least favorite character? <eos> Probably Jar Jar Binks.
No way? That's crazy. <eos> Right? <eos> Yeah, very.
Hi. <eos> Have you seen all the star wars films? <eos> Yes as a matter of fact I have.
Nice. <eos> Out of all of those do you have a least favorite? <eos> Definitely one from the prequels.
Definitely one from the prequels. <eos> Which one? <eos> Probably Clone Wars.
Yeah, it came out in 1977. <eos> Who knew it would be so popular? <eos> I don't think anyone knew.
Definitely Palpatine. <eos> Why is that? <eos> Her fighting style, her aggressiveness, her Britishness.
Mine is Master Yoda. <eos> What do you think of Star Wars since Disney took over? <eos> I think they actually did a great job.
Those are the ones that were released in the 2000s. <eos> Wait so the order of Star Wars goes 4,5,6,1,2, and 3? <eos> Yeah according to George Lucas.
Its about the beginnings of the death star. <eos> Did Vader make it? <eos> No, he was in it though.
No, he was in it though. <eos> Was he a main character? <eos> Kind of.  He was in it a little.
Kind of.  He was in it a little. <eos> Did he use the force? <eos> Yes.  It was awesome.
Personally I liked Episode 1. <eos> Why do you say that? <eos> Because I really enjoyed Jar Jar Binks.
Because I really enjoyed Jar Jar Binks. <eos> No one likes Jar Jar, how could you? <eos> Because I thought he was funny.
And not just following around Hans Solo. <eos> Are you looking forward to the new movie? <eos> Yes.  I hope there will be ewoks.
Remember the end of the STAR WARS original movie. <eos> Like when they were trying to destroy the DEATH STAR? <eos> Yes, that's it. It was intense.
I think we was on screen. <eos> Did have that sash around his shoulder yet? <eos> Yes, it looked the same as always.
Dang, that's a tough one... Rey, I guess. <eos> Do you like ewoks or wookies more? <eos> Hmm... Wookies.
Hmm... Wookies. <eos> Wookies?! Why not ewoks? <eos> Because they look weird.
Because they look weird. <eos> HA HA! Really? <eos> Yeah, totally creepy looking.
Leave it to the studios to make something worse. <eos> How about George Lucas? <eos> True. Probably as much his fault.
He might, but as a ghost. <eos> How does the girl use the force so well without training? <eos> I don't know, maybe the next movie will explain it.
True. It almost made up for the movie being so boring. <eos> You didn't like Empire Strike Back? <eos> No. Return of the Jedi is my favorite.
Yeah. <eos> Who is playing the lead? <eos> Donald Glover.
Donald Glover. <eos> Who is that? <eos> The guy from community and also he raps as Childish Gambino.
Yes. He looked strange. <eos> Was that the movie that Luke's arm got cut off? <eos> I think so.
You'd think that but there are a couple reasons. <eos> Oh? Like what? <eos> Well the crystals are extremely rare first of all.
I think because he was badly burned. <eos> Who is the character that looks like a dog? <eos> That is Chewbacca.
That is Chewbacca. <eos> Why is Jar-Jar Binks so hated? <eos> He is annoying and constantly ruined things.
Hi. <eos> Are you a fan of the Star Wars series? <eos> Yeah love them.
Cool. <eos> Who is your least favorite character? <eos> Without a doubt Jar Jar Binks.
I really liked the blind, force sensitive monk Chirrut. <eos> What did you like about him? <eos> His apparent connection to the Force.
And they have to eat. <eos> Yes, and? <eos> Some of them are in super tiny planes by themselves.
I really like Lando. <eos> Even though he kind of stabbed his friends in the back? <eos> Yeah, but he makes up for it.
Rouge One. <eos> No! Have you? <eos> Yes, it was a great film.
Yes, it was a great film. <eos> Was it better than the prequels? <eos> Well, I would consider this film a prequel.
Well, I would consider this film a prequel. <eos> What do you mean? <eos> This film takes place before all of the others.
Hi. <eos> Do you like Star Wars at all? <eos> Yeah sure.
Yeah sure. <eos> What's the last one you saw? <eos> I saw the force unleashed.
I saw the force unleashed. <eos> Didn't see rogue one? <eos> No not yet.
I saw one just yesterday. <eos> Really! What movie was it? <eos> It was The Empire Strikes Back.
Yes, but his family was quickly killed. So was Leia's. <eos> It does seem like parents are always dying, doesn't it? <eos> I can't think of a single family unit that stays together.
Not much. <eos> What stars wars movie is your least favorite? <eos> That is an interesting question.
Yoda, it is. <eos> Don't you wish he was in the new movies? <eos> Dead he is.
True that is. <eos> What about young Yoda? Like when he was in training? <eos> Yes, interesting that would be.
Ha, he was funny, but raises a lot of ethical questions. <eos> Yours? <eos> R2D2. He's super functional and is sort of an deus-ex-machina.
R2D2. He's super functional and is sort of an deus-ex-machina. <eos> So what's the ethical issue? <eos> If you create a robot with personality, it's alive and conscious.
It can be hard because they are all so good. <eos> Are you excited about the new one coming out? <eos> Oh you mean the Last Jedi? Oh my God yes.
Yes, and John Boyega. <eos> Who's Jon Boyega? <eos> Boyega plays the storm trooper who doesn't want to kill anymore.
Hi there. <eos> Did you hear they are making a new Han Solo movie? <eos> Yeah I did hear that.
It's definitely the best one. <eos> Who is your favorite character? <eos> Leia, of course.
Leia, of course. <eos> Why is Leia your favorite? <eos> She's beautiful, but poised in a world facing danger.
She's beautiful, but poised in a world facing danger. <eos> Did you see The Force Awakens yet? <eos> Yes, we saw it in the theater opening night.
Yes, he is very funny in Return of the Jedi. <eos> Wasn't he in the first one? <eos> Not originally, but in the updated one yes.
I wondered why it looked so different. <eos> Was he always supposed to be a big worm looking guy? <eos> Actually there was an actor who played him originally.
That was Return of the Jedi. <eos> Huh? <eos> Roge One was a prequel to A New Hope.
It was good but had some flaws. <eos> like what? <eos> Rey is too good at everything.
Hey. <eos> What is your favorite of all the star wars films? <eos> I really like the force unleased a lot.
I really like the force unleased a lot. <eos> Was that the most recent one? <eos> No, I think the most recent one was rogue one.
Ah okay. <eos> Did you like that one? <eos> Yeah I really did enjoy that one.
Yeah, time really flies. <eos> What did you think of the movie on this go around? <eos> It seemed more cute than realistic.
Yeah, I love all the movies. <eos> Even the prequels? <eos> Well, those were okay. I guess I didn't love them.
I'm not sure. I thought that was a pretty weird explination. <eos> Why did they even need to explain? <eos> Guess it just put some "science" behind it.
no, I wasn't even born yet. <eos> which Star Wars character is your favorite? <eos> especially with today's technology and artificial intelligence C-3PO is my favorite.
Yes, I like them all very much I am a fan. <eos> Who are you favorite characters in the movies? <eos> I like the Ewok in Return of the Jedi.
C3-PO for sure. <eos> Oh yeah? <eos> Yeah, I really like his back story.
Yeah, I really like his back story. <eos> How do you mean? <eos> The actor inside the suit also voiced the character.
The actor inside the suit also voiced the character. <eos> So? <eos> They were going to have a voice actor do it.
Man, Rogue One is such a messy Star Wars film. <eos> In a good way though, right? <eos> I don't know. It just feels disjointed.
The Empire Strikes Back is my favorite. <eos> It's mine too! What's your favorite part? <eos> When Han gets frozen and Leia tells him she loves him.
I just never really got in to them. <eos> How is that possible? <eos> For one, I think they're a bit long and drawn out.
I'm lucky in a way. <eos> How's that? <eos> My memory is so bad, I'm still occasionally surprised.
That was pretty awesome. <eos> Yours? <eos> Kylo Ren's.
No, he gets killed. <eos> Too bad.  What else happens? <eos> She gets the schematics to Princess Leia before getting killed.
I watched it a few weeks ago with my daughter. <eos> Which was her favorite movie? <eos> She liked Return of the Jedi best.
Hey. <eos> What was the last star wars movie you saw? <eos> I saw rogue one not to long ago.
I saw rogue one not to long ago. <eos> Cool, where did you see that? <eos> I saw it in the theater with some friends.
Wait, not the Empire... <eos> Yeah, what are they called? <eos> I can't remeber.
Probably when Kylo Ren stops a blaster bullet in mid-air. <eos> More than Vader stopping them in Empire? <eos> Far more.
Hello. <eos> You a fan of star wars? <eos> Yeah I love star wars.
Yeah I love star wars. <eos> Same here.  Who is your favorite star wars character? <eos> I like bobba fett.
That's true, but they could always use force ghosts. <eos> That's true. Do you think Obiwan will show up any? <eos> I sure hope so, he's my favourite character from the prequels.
Yeah, The Empire Strikes Back. <eos> Okay, any particular reason why that's your favorite? <eos> I love the snow battle with the AT-ATs and the airspeeders.
Cool. Me too. <eos> Who is your favorite character? <eos> I like Luke.
It was okay. <eos> Did you atleast like Kylo Ren? <eos> They did that character really well.
Yes definitely. <eos> I wonder who snoke really is? <eos> I heard many theories out there.
Yes. Luke's journey was really cool. <eos> What did you think of Han Solo's journey? <eos> I thought it was good that he was being hunted.
No, I mean The Last Jedi. <eos> That's the sequel to The Force Awakens, right? <eos> Yeah, it is.
I like the Hans Solo character. <eos> Oh, you like the rebel bad boy with a good heart? <eos> Yes, I like the tough guy persona of Han.
"Return of the Jedi" was released in 1983. <eos> Who directed "Return of the Jedi"? <eos> It was directed by Richard Marquand.
Poe Dameron? He was great, too.  I love Oscar Isaac. <eos> Were you upset when Han died? <eos> Yes, but I figured Harrison Ford wouldn't do many more sequels.
Those fluffy little teddy bears? I don't think so. <eos> What about Chewbacca? <eos> Chewbacca is no ones sidekick. He is his own man.
Right. And Luke flies one, so we have to like it. <eos> But aren't TIE fighters kind of weird looking? <eos> They do seem like they'd be stiff or something.
I still like A New Hope. <eos> Oh really? <eos> Yeah it is such a classic.
Yeah it is such a classic. <eos> Who was your favorite actor in it? <eos> I like James Earl Jones.
Those are phony. The ones from the eighties are the best. <eos> You mean the original and then like The Empire Strikes Back? <eos> The first three, including those two and Return of the Jedi.
Yes I do. <eos> Well, how does Leia remember?  Didn't Padmé die during childbirth? <eos> That brings up a very interesting dilemma.  You're right.
There was one scene that was better with CGI though. <eos> Which one was that? <eos> The Yoda fight scene where he bounces all around the room.
I've always been really curious about Stormtrooper armor. <eos> What do you mean? <eos> Well, it seems like it's really useless.
Yes. That is one of my favorites. <eos> Did you like them in the newest movie? <eos> Not really. They did not do much.
I'd say so, Rodian bounty hunters are spooky. <eos> You know Greedo shot first right? <eos> Of course I know that. Everybody knows that.
I thought it was a litte boring. <eos> Why do you say that? <eos> Because there were new characters I suppose.
I agree. There was a lot of potential there. <eos> Did you like his costume? <eos> The black robe was perfect.
The black robe was perfect. <eos> What about the horns? <eos> The horns were a bit too much for me.
I believe its coming to Netflix. <eos> The movie? <eos> They are writing it to become a series.
Once Lucas ceded control you knew this would happen. <eos> But would people tune into that? <eos> Absolutely, its money in the bank.
He almost had zero dialogue, but was still so scary. <eos> Did you know that Ray Park did his own stunts? <eos> I didn't.  That's very impressive.
No, I am your father. <eos> How do they say it wrong? <eos> They say, Luke I am your father.
I like Return of the Jedi best. <eos> Who is your favorite Star Wars character? <eos> My favorite character is Chewbacca.
The original trilogy. <eos> Who do you like better Hans or Luke? <eos> That's a hard decision, I like both the same.
I prefer Han's Solo more, but Luke is cool to. <eos> Why do you like Solo more? <eos> I love Harrison Ford plus I love his character arc.
Oh yes I absolutely love the Star Wars movies. <eos> They are just the greatest, aren't they? <eos> Totally agreed.
Totally agreed. <eos> Which actor do you like best? <eos> I love Carrie Fisher in the movie.
Ok, I guess I see your point. <eos> Did you decide who your favorite character is? <eos> You're going to laugh. I really like Jobba the Hutt.
Yes I agree with you on that one. <eos> So do you think Darth Maul was better? <eos> No he wasnt even around long enough to say that.
I saw number three. <eos> Oh cool, were you into that one? <eos> Yeah it was interesting.
Yeah it was interesting. <eos> What was your favorite part? <eos> I loved the part where anakin became darth vader.
Yes, but I like the older ones the best. <eos> Which one is your favorite? <eos> I like The Empire Strikes Back.
He was in the original Star Wars. <eos> What was his name in the movie? <eos> Anakin Skywalker. You know , Lukes father.
I had dreams about it for a week after. <eos> What kind of dreams? <eos> About flying a tie fighter and trying to kill darth vader.
Jeff, Amanda, and Katie are in the movie. <eos> Was Hayden Christensen his dreamy self? <eos> He did another good job as Anakin.
Do yourself a favor and watch The Empire Strikes Back. <eos> Isn't that his debut film? <eos> That's right. Maybe you can learn a thing or two.
Yes he does do the right thing most of the time. <eos> Anything else? <eos> He has an appearance most people would be afraid of.
Both directors are gone. <eos> What happened? <eos> I heard they had creative differences with other people.
I heard they had creative differences with other people. <eos> Do they know who the new director will be? <eos> It looks like Ron Howard.
I mean, I've always liked Chewbacca. <eos> I do too. What is he again? <eos> He's a Wookie. At least I think that's what they're called.
It wasn't as bad as everybody made it out to be. <eos> Okay, so what is this funny scene? <eos> It's something that Darth Vader says.
The Empire Strikes Back id my favorite. <eos> Who is your favorite Star Wars character? <eos> Princess Leia is my favorite.
Well it introduced us to a whole new set of people. <eos> I take it you liked them quite a bit? <eos> I enjoyed Rey and Kylo's stories the most.
Yeah and that seems bad. <eos> Like morally wrong? <eos> Not that, but just write her out.
I doubt it they're too totally different models of robot. <eos> That's a good point but still think it's possible? <eos> Yeah anythings possible just unlikely.
Yeah, though I did love Watto. <eos> And, who can forget Darth Maul? <eos> Yeah, I'd love to see more with him.
The Wookies are amazing characters. <eos> What planet do they live on? <eos> Kashyyk.
Kashyyk. <eos> Isn't that the planet Yoda escaped from? <eos> Yes. One of the Wookies escorted him to a pod.
Yes. One of the Wookies escorted him to a pod. <eos> Where did he end up? <eos> On a planet in the Degobah system.
Yes I have. <eos> Who is your favorite character? <eos> That has to be Darth Vader.
I doubt it. <eos> Did you like Episode 7? <eos> It was okay. It was very digital.
Sometimes, but usually i see it at home. <eos> Will you go see the new one? <eos> Yes. i look forward to seeing the new star wars movie.
You know that could be. I never thought about that. <eos> Is there a mandatory sentence minimum for Star Wars smugglers? <eos> I bet it depends on the cargo.
Yes, I liked episode one a lot. <eos> What about Jar Jar Binks? <eos> I think people are too hard on him.
BB8, cool!  He's adorable. <eos> And capable, right? <eos> Naturally.  JJ created a next-gen robot with heart.
What did you think of Ron Howard being the new director. <eos> For what? <eos> The Han Solo, solo film.
I did not know that. I think it is alright. <eos> I wonder why JJ Abrams would not direct it? <eos> I would say due to the fact it will be awful.
I would say due to the fact it will be awful. <eos> Why you say that? <eos> It does not make sense.
It does not make sense. <eos> Why not? <eos> We already know what happens to him.
I saw the second one. <eos> Oh yeah was that any good do you think? <eos> I enjoyed it.
I enjoyed it. <eos> How was the relationship between anakin and the princess? <eos> They were very cute together.
They were very cute together. <eos> It seemed very futuristic, don't you think? <eos> Definitely.
I like the Cantina song. <eos> You mean Jabba Flow from The Force Awakens? <eos> No. I mean from the original Star Wars movie.
Oh that song was pretty good. <eos> Which song do you like best? <eos> I like the Darth Vader march.
So, Star Wars is pretty awesome. <eos> I know right! what's your favorite one? <eos> I like Episode one.
Yeah, I guess I see your point kind of. <eos> What about you dude? What's your favorite? <eos> The original. Yoda in the swamp can't go wrong.
They are Ewoks. <eos> Are they friendly? <eos> No. They are pretty violent.
No. They are pretty violent. <eos> Why do they like Luke, Leia and Han? <eos> Because they think C3PO is their god.
Because they think C3PO is their god. <eos> What planet do they live on? <eos> They live on Endor.
They live on Endor. <eos> Is it an Imperial planet? <eos> No, they only use it as an out-post.
I liked the romance aspect of it. <eos> Between Anakin and Padme? <eos> Yes, I liked the way he always loved her.
See, my money's on the Emperor. <eos> The Emperor? Really? <eos> Yeah. He only lost because of a surprise attack.
Hello good fellow. <eos> Hello do you like Star Wars? <eos> Yes it's jolly good fun.
Yes it's jolly good fun. <eos> Do you find R2D2 simpatico? <eos> Yes he's a jolly little droid.
Okay. Luke defeats Vader. <eos> Is that all? <eos> No. There is much more.
I actually like the characters the best. <eos> Who's your favorite character? <eos> I love Darth Vader because he's so deliciously evil.
I bet he thought a lot about his dad. <eos> You mean Darth? <eos> Luuuuuke, I am your father.
I cant say that is true. <eos> Why not? <eos> I thought it had too haphazard of a story line.
I thought it had too haphazard of a story line. <eos> How so? <eos> Luke's character seemed stale.
Luke's character seemed stale. <eos> So you think Mark Hamill underperformed? <eos> I wouldnt say that completely.
The force awakens. <eos> Do you think they will bring harrison ford back? <eos> no.
And Jedi are supposed to fashion their own lightsabers. <eos> Using a crystal, right? <eos> Yes, the khyber crystal I think I heard.
The Luke and Vader fight. <eos> You mean the part when Vader reveals who he really is? <eos> Yes. That part was very cool.
I don't think anyone was. <eos> Did you think the fight was choreographed well? <eos> Yes. It was one of the best fights in film history.
Leia is my favorite female character. <eos> Why? <eos> Because my only other choice is Amydala and she sucked.
Yeah but not at first. <eos> Did you like the story plot? <eos> I did actually I thought it was well done.
Diego Luna. <eos> Wasn't the girl hot? <eos> Felicity Jones?  She was great.
Felicity Jones?  She was great. <eos> Wasn't Forest Whitaker in that? <eos> He played one of Jyn's mentors.
No way! That would have been creepy. <eos> Maybe it would have made it better? <eos> Nothing could have made that character better in my opinion.
He is such an excellent actor. <eos> You know the first movie I saw him in? <eos> Which one.
Me too. They are well done. <eos> Do you like the new ones? <eos> Not really.
I think he would think it was silly. <eos> Why is that? <eos> He was just sort of boring before the original trilogy.
Maybe why he was in trouble with him. <eos> What did you think when Vader put Solo in the Carbonite? <eos> That was actual not originally part of the plot.
That is true and it is better choreographed. <eos> Did you like when Luke got his hand cut off? <eos> That was a big surprise.
I'm not sure we will have to see. <eos> Do you think she will end up dying in the movies? <eos> I hope not.
there are a lot of theories going on around her. <eos> really? how so? <eos> some people think that she is obi wans granddaughter.
kind of, but i would rather see her with other parents. <eos> why do you think that? <eos> people would freak out if the theory was true.
Well I like it. <eos> Why do you like it? <eos> Because it shows the development of Anakin to the dark side.
Because it shows the development of Anakin to the dark side. <eos> Wasn't it sad when Padme died? <eos> Oh yeah that was so sad.
When they re-released A New Hope, they edited the Greedo scene. <eos> How so? <eos> They made it look like Greedo shot first.
I dont like the picture in my head at all. <eos> Do you think they are just big people? <eos> Well I mean, chewie has fangs, so, no.
Kylo Ren gets positioned as a villain. <eos> Mmm hmm. What else? <eos> The new trilogy can go in a different direction.
My eyes were glued to the TV the whole time. <eos> Favourite part? <eos> Oh, probably the whole relationship between r2d2 and c3po.
This one is different. It is a Star Wars crossword puzzle. <eos> Oh, awesome! How can I help? <eos> Well, I''m on my last word.
I like Anakin Skywalker he is my favorite. <eos> You like the bad guys? <eos> Yes, I liked the whole turning to the Dark Side plot.
It reminds me of the human condition. <eos> You mean the struggle between right and wrong? <eos> Yes, I think everyone has it in them a bit.
That's a good point. <eos> Do you think it was a cool concept? <eos> I absolutely loved the idea and it was rather shocking.
It's different when you can just put on a suit. <eos> Were there any others that you found particularly impressive? <eos> I always thought Bib Fortuna was cool looking.
Yes I have. <eos> Do you like Obi-Won? <eos> Yes but he's too trusting.
Yeah. <eos> No I did not. Did you? <eos> Yes I did. It was great.
Yes I did. It was great. <eos> How was it to see carrie fisher and harrison ford back? <eos> It was amazing! I loved seeing them back.
It was amazing! I loved seeing them back. <eos> How were the new actors? <eos> They were alright.
I saw The Empire Strikes Back. <eos> Wasn't there another director than Lucas for that? <eos> Irvin Kershner.
Frank Oz. <eos> Is it in this movie that Han and Leia get attracted? <eos> Yes, they kiss in the asteroid scene.
Yes, they kiss in the asteroid scene. <eos> Doesn't Luke lose his hand? <eos> Yes, he gets a prosthetic one in the end.
They fired the directors. <eos> Why did they do this? <eos> Creative differences is the official reason.
Creative differences is the official reason. <eos> Didn't they already start filming? <eos> They sure did, I not sure how much they've done.
I like the first one for sure. <eos> Do you mean episode 4 or episode 1? <eos> Oh that's funny. I was thinking Episode 1.
Well, it's better than the prequels, that's for sure. <eos> It's not as good as the other original trilogy movies? <eos> That's right. It's not quite there.
That's right. It's not quite there. <eos> Why? Is it something about originality? <eos> Mostly that's it. It's far more recycled than the others.
I like a lot of it. <eos> What's your favorite? <eos> Darth Vader's theme.  Suits him.
I thought she was too powerful and had a flat personality. <eos> Did you like Finn? <eos> Yes, I liked him a lot more.
I've seen some really good ones. <eos> So who do you think her father is? <eos> Personally, I'm betting it's Han Solo.
I saw Return of the Jedi last night. <eos> Which version? <eos> The Blu-Ray disc, 2011.
Yes, the Anakin from Star Wars III is shown. <eos> What about the Sarlacc? <eos> They added a computer generated beak.
Nah man, CGI! We could have had a badass Han Solo. <eos> What is your obsession with Han Solo? <eos> Han Solo...
Me too. He really stood out especially against vader. <eos> What did you think of Carrie Fisher's character? <eos> Well she also does an amazing job.
I agree. <eos> What was your favorite part? <eos> When Vader tells luke he is his father.
I just saw Star Wars IV. <eos> Wow, the first Star Wars.  Who was your favorite character? <eos> Carrie Fisher as Princess Leia.
He uses the force and shoots somwething into the reactor. <eos> Cool. Does he get any help? <eos> Han Solo comes in and saves him at the last minute.
He kinda was. But, at the end he changed a lot. <eos> What was his friend's name? <eos> Chewbacca.
I like the Jedi characters like Obi Wan and Rey. <eos> Did you like the prequel movies at all? <eos> They were OK but not nearly as good as the original.
They were OK but not nearly as good as the original. <eos> Did you like any of the Jedi in those movies? <eos> I liked Liam Neeson's character but that's about it.
You should probably just watch the movies again. <eos> All of them? <eos> I mean, that makes the most sense to me.
Yeah. Then in 2016 with Rogue One. <eos> What's this years film again? <eos> This year's film is going to be The Last Jedi.
This year's film is going to be The Last Jedi. <eos> What's it supposed to be about? <eos> It's supposed to revolve more around Luke and Leia, I believe.
The directors were removed due to creative differences. <eos> Wow! So who is the director now? <eos> The new director is Ron Howard, it was just announced today.
I did not like the second movie. <eos> Oh really? <eos> Yeah.
Yeah. <eos> Why not though? <eos> It was kind of boring to be honest.
It was kind of boring to be honest. <eos> You didn't like the acting? <eos> The acting was not as good as the older ones.
Yes. It is a great name. <eos> Is he your favorite character? <eos> No. I like Yoda.
Seesaw peacha wonti Chewbacca. <eos> Haha, what does that mean? <eos> At last we've captured the mighty Chewbacca.
I saw Attack of the Clones yesterday. <eos> Cool.  Was Liam Neeson in that one? <eos> No, he was in The Phantom Menace.
Yes. <eos> Was Jar Jar Binks there? <eos> A small role.
It is really good -we should watch it. <eos> Who is in it? <eos> Harrison Frord plats Han Solo and Carroe Fisher plays Princess Leia.
Harrison Frord plats Han Solo and Carroe Fisher plays Princess Leia. <eos> Didn't Carrie Fisher die recently? <eos> Yeah her and her mom both passed away.
Luke Skywalker. <eos> How come he is your favorite? <eos> Because he is a Jedi Master.
Yep. initially. But they have a databse now. Holocron database. <eos> Named after the Holocron of Jedi's? <eos> Yep. The ancient repositories of knowledge and wisdom.
I agree. <eos> What  other actors do you like? <eos> I like James Earl Jones as the voice of Vader.
I definitely liked Star Wars more growing up. <eos> Who was your favorite character? <eos> Han Solo was my favorite.
I hated it. <eos> Really? What about the last scene? <eos> That would be an exception. That was amazing.
As a die-hard Star Wars fan, I completely understand that. <eos> How are you able to keep up with everything? <eos> The films just appeal to me. Nothing too specific.
The films just appeal to me. Nothing too specific. <eos> You just like the movies overall? <eos> Yeah, and it's been that way since I was a child.
Yeah, and it's been that way since I was a child. <eos> Could you explain the story to me a bit? <eos> I could, if it was simple enough to summarize 8 movies.
Okay that sounds fun. <eos> Which star wars is your favorite? <eos> I like the sixth one.
I like the sixth one. <eos> Who is your favorite in that? <eos> I like Jabba.
By that thinking, no evil person can do anything good. <eos> Why would they? <eos> Self-preservation.
That doesn't make sense. Darth vader died. <eos> Well, he turned into a Force Ghost, remeber? <eos> Wait, oh yeah, you're right.
Yes, that the force made him, with his mom. <eos> So, he is more than half metaclhorins? <eos> Yep, weird but yes.
I always thought that part was odd. <eos> Would they not have been a bit afraid of him? <eos> I would think it was odd, him being so powerful.
Yeah I like some of them. <eos> Which are your least favorites? <eos> I actually do not like the older ones that much.
Well I really enjoy the first three. <eos> Why is that? <eos> Because they have better special effects.
Yup. Bossk. <eos> Which one was that? <eos> The lizard looking guy.
"A New Hope" was released in 1977. <eos> Have they released all of the movies in the series? <eos> No, they are supposed to start filming Episode IX in 2017.
That seems very Un-Star Wars like. <eos> Granted. So who's Rey daddy? <eos> Based solely on her English Accent, Ben Kenobi.
Yes sometimes. <eos> Who is your favorite character? <eos> I like Jarjar Binks.
That may be true but I have not personally heard that. <eos> What about Chewy? <eos> I like Chewy too he is great.
I think he is going to become good. <eos> Oh really? <eos> Yeah, it seemed like he has that part inside of him.
Yes, I've seen it many times. <eos> Who is your favorite character in the Empire Strikes Back? <eos> Definitely Yoda, my favorite character of any science-fiction movie.
Definitely Yoda, my favorite character of any science-fiction movie. <eos> What your favorite thing about Yoda? <eos> His facial expressions, they're funny.
I always wondered how they made his costume so realistic. <eos> I wonder if there was a real person inside? <eos> Darth Vader definitely had a real person inside.
I liked Obi Wan and Watto the best. <eos> Did you like Jar Jar? <eos> He was very funny.
He was very funny. <eos> Did you like the end fight with Darth Maul? <eos> Yes. That as epic.
Yes. That as epic. <eos> Did you like Queen Amidala? <eos> I liked her costumes. They were nice.
Yes I do. <eos> What is your favorite character? <eos> I like Han Solo because he is very slick.
So you know, Greedo shot first. <eos> Um, says you? <eos> Come on.
Of course, but I like the old ones the best. <eos> The old movies made or the oldest storyline? <eos> The older movies. The ones with Harrison Ford and Leia.
I'd have to say Mace Windu. <eos> Really, nay particular reasons? <eos> Well, first he is a badass character, tough and battle ready.
Aside from Rogue One and the Han Solo movie. <eos> Right.  What other ones should they do? <eos> I would actually like to see a Yoda origin story.
When he must have had some adventures. <eos> So thats the timeframe they'll cover? <eos> I'm pretty sure.That's what I heard.
I just saw The Force Awakens. <eos> Who directed it? <eos> J.J. Abrams, the Star Trek movie director.
J.J. Abrams, the Star Trek movie director. <eos> Cool.  Who was your favorite in the movie? <eos> Carrie Fisher, in her last role.  She still looked good.
Carrie Fisher, in her last role.  She still looked good. <eos> How about Rey? <eos> Daisy Ridley?  She was magnificent.
Kylo Ren's lightsaber is so weird. <eos> What do you mean? <eos> He's got the lightsaber beams coming out of the side.
30 years. <eos> So how old is Snoke? <eos> He's a force sensitive alien. His age doesn't matter.
The Jokes, it had great jokes in the first one. <eos> How so? <eos> Well, the way Luke interacts with his aunt and uncle.
It's not my favorite, but I think it could be fun. <eos> Why not? <eos> I just never cared for Jar-jar.
Probably the All Terrain Armored Transport. <eos> Which one? <eos> The AT-AT walker.
They look like big dogs. <eos> That's why you like them? <eos> No. Just an observation.
I don't know, some kind of binary jargon I guess. <eos> How is it that every Star Wars character is multilingual? <eos> They must have gone to really good schools.
I disagree with that. It was the best. <eos> What? You think the new movie was better than "Empire"? <eos> Yes, I do. Absolutely.
I think this ruins Star Wars. <eos> Why? <eos> Because the plot needs to be linear.
That would be the Force Awakens. <eos> Why that one? <eos> I love the two new main characters Rey and Kylo.
Huh, I had no idea. <eos> Weird, huh? <eos> Maybe nobody wanted to get close enough to present him.
Also, the word "Ewok" is never mentioned in the movies. <eos> Are you sure? <eos> Yeah, the name only appears in the script.
Sort of, I like the three that were released first. <eos> Which one is your favorite? <eos> That's easy, The Empire Strikes Back.
Return of the Jedi runs a close second though. <eos> Why do you say that? <eos> I have always been a big fan of Jabba the Hut.
I heard they got a new director for Episode VIII. <eos> Really? <eos> Yup.
He needed to get him away from his father, Darth Vader. <eos> Where did his sister end up at? <eos> She ended up on the planet of Alderaan.
I never understood that scene. <eos> Maybe it was a foreshadowing of things to come? <eos> Perhaps, I guess Yoda was just screwing with him.
He'd probably end up lopping off an arm at some point. <eos> His? Or someone else's? <eos> Depends on how drunk he is, I'd imagine.
Oh, yes, I saw that one. <eos> Did you like it? <eos> It was really cool.
It had the nar scene wuth all those creatures. <eos> Yeah what was in the other two? <eos> Empire Strikes Back had an ice world.
Yeah that one eas my favorite. <eos> What about Return pf the Jedi? <eos> That was the one with the Ewoks in the forest.
I have never really liked Yoda. <eos> Who do you like? <eos> Chewbacca has to be my favorite.
One of the thing's I've always liked is the merchandise. <eos> Like all of the toy light sabers and things like that? <eos> Yeah. It's a great way to expose kids to it.
She seems like such a hero, so I get it. <eos> Who is your favorite character? <eos> I love Kylo Ren.
Yeah, I guess you're right. <eos> They both live up in the trees don't they? <eos> Yes, they share that characteristic.
Yes, they share that characteristic. <eos> Do wookies worship all things golden like ewoks? <eos> I don't think so. They are definitely smarter creatures.
Yeah he is a great villain, hes scary. <eos> Whose your favorite character? <eos> I like Han Solo I think hes pretty cool.
He is a good actor. <eos> Did he send Luke to find Yoda? <eos> Yes, I believe he did in the second movie.
Yes, I believe he did in the second movie. <eos> Which one was that? <eos> That was in The Empire Strikes Back.
Oh, I see... <eos> Do i need more of a reason? <eos> I guess not..
No, he was in some of the movies. <eos> Which one or ones? <eos> I know he was in the Phantom Menace for sure.
I know he was in the Phantom Menace for sure. <eos> He was Obi-Wan, right? <eos> Oh no, Anakin hadn't befriended him at the time.
Oh no, Anakin hadn't befriended him at the time. <eos> Then what was his name? <eos> Qui-Gon Jinn I think.
Hello. <eos> Do you like Star Wars? <eos> Yeah sure.
That's easy. <eos> What is it? <eos> The first prequel.   It was terrible.
Ugh, I hate all the hype about Star Wars. <eos> What? You don't like Star Wars? <eos> I hate it! The movies are so bad.
I hate it! The movies are so bad. <eos> Are you kidding? Have you seen them all? <eos> No, Just the one's that came out in the 90s.
I hated when Chewi started to wail. <eos> Do you think they will kill the Luke character? <eos> I think the next movie will focus on him.
Hello. <eos> Do you like star wars? <eos> Yeah sure.
Yeah sure. <eos> Do you have a favorite character from the films? <eos> I really like Han Solo.
Yeah he's great. <eos> What about you? <eos> I like Luke.
That was a Star Killer, not a Death Star. <eos> Well, aren't the two weapons functionally similar? <eos> Yes, I guess so, with the latter just being bigger.
Maybe.... <eos> What do you mean? <eos> His last attempt didn't turn out so well.
Episode IV: A New Hope. <eos> What was the name of the first movie in the series? <eos> Episode 1: The Phantom Menace.
Hi. <eos> Have you seen all the star wars films? <eos> Yes I have.
Oh I think thats in Return of the Jedi. <eos> What about you which one did you liked the most? <eos> I liked episode 6, that movie changed my childhood forever.
Oh, I love it. Its so gorgeous. <eos> Which scenes are you thinking of? <eos> It was interesting to me how they completely computer-generated Princess Leia.
Yes, clearly. <eos> What's the worst Star Wars movie? <eos> The first 2 prequels.
Yes, but I was seven in 1977. <eos> Do you still remember it? <eos> Believe it or not, yes I still remember seeing it.
Think that is true of only a couple other movies. <eos> What did you like about it? <eos> It is a coming of age story of Luke Skywalker.
... <eos> What? <eos> He's short and green...
It has something to do with the crystals. <eos> Did they ever cover that in the movies? <eos> I don't believe so.
I don't believe so. <eos> How do you know then? <eos> I think they mentioned it in the cartoons.
That's great! I know the last movie was awesome. <eos> What was the name of the last one? <eos> The name of the last movie was Rogue One.
The effects were beautiful, too. <eos> What about the plot? <eos> I liked that the early scenes with Rey took their time.
I don't think so. <eos> Why wouldn't they? <eos> I read that the original helmet was flawed.
I read that the original helmet was flawed. <eos> In what way? <eos> Something to do with it not being semetrical.
I'm not sure I'm down with the new Star Wars plot. <eos> Why not? <eos> It kinda paints Skywalker as a coward.
It was okay. <eos> What did you like? <eos> I liked the intro and I liked some of the puppets.
I wonder how he was recruited. <eos> How do the Sith recruit? <eos> Probably issue a draft.
Hello. <eos> Would you call yourself a fan of Star Wars? <eos> Yeah I would say so.
Yeah I would say so. <eos> Who is your favorite character from the films? <eos> I love Lando.
I love Lando. <eos> Really, why? <eos> Well Billy D. Williams is just so cool.
Yeah, it's one of the older ones. <eos> When did it come out? <eos> I'm not sure, before I was born.
I think I might have seen it. <eos> Which ones have you seen then? <eos> I saw the one where Luke fights DarthVader.
I saw the one where Luke fights DarthVader. <eos> You mean when he gets his hand cut off? <eos> Yeah, that's the one.
Hi. <eos> Do you know about Star Wars? <eos> I know a little bit about it.
I know a little bit about it. <eos> Have you seen all the films? <eos> I have seen most of them.
I have seen most of them. <eos> Do you have one that you like the best? <eos> I really liked Rogue One a lot.
I really liked Rogue One a lot. <eos> Is that the newest one that came out? <eos> Yeah I think so.
Hey there. <eos> Do you like Star Wars? <eos> Absolutely.
yeah. <eos> I don't know.  Maybe the dark? <eos> Oh interesting.
Right, but still they are not as good. <eos> How do you think they hold up to the prequels? <eos> I would put the Force Awakens on par with episode two.
I also like the episode" Revenge of the Sith". <eos> Did you like the episode "Empire Strikes Back"? <eos> Yes!, I also like," Return of the Jedi", both excellent movies.
Yes. He is silver in that one. <eos> What color is he in the first one? <eos> Many. He is only wires and they are many different colors.
Yep. <eos> Well whatever, have you seen it or not? <eos> Nope, but I read about that quote.
Hey. <eos> Do you like the Star Wars universe? <eos> I do, yes.
I do, yes. <eos> What do you like most about it? <eos> I love the jedis and lightsabers.
No, I hate the new ones. <eos> Oh, so you watched the old ones then? <eos> Yes, I've seen all the old ones.
Yes, I've seen all the old ones. <eos> What's so great about the old ones? <eos> Their characters were cooler.
Their characters were cooler. <eos> Which characters? <eos> Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Chewbacca, were all amazing characters.
Probably not. <eos> Why not? <eos> I haven't seen the last one, so I would be lost.
Not really, I quit watching after the Phantom Menace. <eos> You mean you haven't seen the new one? <eos> Nope.
Hello. <eos> Are you interested in Star Wars? <eos> Yeah I like it okay.
So much so they put it in the video game. <eos> Which one? <eos> Battle Front II.
Definitely Han Solo. <eos> Why do you like Han Solo? <eos> Because he was the captain of the spaceship.
It's almost as if they can read each other's minds. <eos> What is your favorite scene in the three older movies? <eos> When Luke finds out that Vader is his father.
It's so good! You'll love it. <eos> Have you already seen it? <eos> Yes, but I would like to see it again.
Hi. <eos> Would you consider yourself a fan of Star Wars? <eos> Yeah I would say so.
Yeah I would say so. <eos> What is it about them that you like? <eos> I like the sci fi setting and jedis.
That's a good answer. <eos> What about you, what do you like about star wars? <eos> I like the action and the huge scope of the movies.
Actually, we're both wrong. <eos> Why? <eos> Yoda wins, obviously.
Hello. <eos> Would you call yourself a fan of Star Wars? <eos> Yeah I would say so.
Yeah I would say so. <eos> Cool.  Do you have a favorite character? <eos> Yep, Darth Vader.
Oh the dark side nice. <eos> What about you? <eos> I like Han Solo.
I like the old ones. <eos> Who is your favorite character? <eos> That's tough. Probably Han Solo.
I think it sucks. <eos> Well are you racist? <eos> Yeah.
Yeah. <eos> Well there ya go. Are you sexist? <eos> Yes.
Your dog reminds me of someone. <eos> Who? <eos> JarJar Binks...an alien from one of thise Star Trek movies.
Oh, it has all that too. <eos> So what's the differnce? <eos> Different part of space..I think...
The movies do not even show what he is. <eos> You mean what type of alien? <eos> Right, they say what Chewie is and so on.
Hello. <eos> Do you like the Star Wars world? <eos> Yeah I love it.
Yeah I love it. <eos> Oh cool  You a big fan? <eos> Yeah I really do love Star Wars.
Name your favorite Jedi. <eos> From Star Wars? <eos> Yes of course.
Interesting take Vader as a weapon. <eos> Well did the emperor just use him more or less? <eos> I suppose that is a good point.
I like the movie where the villain has a red face. <eos> Are you talking about Darth Maul? <eos> I think that is his name.
It is pretty good, not my favorite though. <eos> What one is your favorite? <eos> I like Return of the Jedi.
Hon Solo is like Lord Vader. <eos> What are you talking about? <eos> Well think about it, they both dress mostly with black clothing.
Well think about it, they both dress mostly with black clothing. <eos> Along with half the cast, so what? <eos> Ok, well they both did illegal things for power.
I'll guess something small, like $100,000. <eos> You're so wrong.  Think lower? <eos> $50,000?  It couldn't have been much worse.
$50,000?  It couldn't have been much worse. <eos> He was $10,000 and received no royalties? <eos> What?  That's total madness.
They are okay. <eos> Have you seen them all? <eos> No, just a couple of them.
I really like them. <eos> Who is your favorite character? <eos> Probably C3PO.
Probably C3PO. <eos> Is that the robot? <eos> It sure is.
I want to have a Star Wars movie marathon. <eos> Let's do ot.  Which one do we start eith? <eos> I don't know.  By release date would be Star Ward.
Then Empire Strikes Back. <eos> But what about the order on the story? <eos> It would be Phantom Memace.
That makes sense. <eos> What about you? <eos> I kind of like Hoth.
I kind of like Hoth. <eos> The ice planet? <eos> Yeah. I'm really into the winter aesthetic.
General Leia, hands down. <eos> Really? Why? <eos> Because she's amazing.
Because she's amazing. <eos> How do you think they'll resolve her story? <eos> I don't know. I'm hoping they do her justice.
It's going to be hard, though. <eos> I agree. So who's your favorite character? <eos> Also General Leia.
Hi there. <eos> Are you interested in Star Wars? <eos> Yeah I sure am.
I loved that movie, I thought it was pretty good. <eos> What did you like the most about it? <eos> I liked the Villain, I thought he was so cool.
The newer ones have been really good to see in theaters. <eos> What newer one do you like the most? <eos> I enjoyed Rogue One quite a bit.
I liked it too, but it wasn't my favorite. <eos> Why not? <eos> None of the characters seemed really fleshed out.
And it was patricide also. Man that was dark. <eos> Do you think Finn and Rey are going to get together? <eos> Actually I do. Star Wars needs a new love affair.
Cautiously excited. <eos> Only cautiously? <eos> I'm worried because both directors left.
Hi there. <eos> Do you like Star Wars? <eos> I'm more of a Star Trek guy.
I'm more of a Star Trek guy. <eos> Have you seen all of the Star Wars films? <eos> Yeah I have seen them all.
Yeah, I guess it wouldn't be Star Wars without them. <eos> Aren't they in every single one? <eos> I believe so. Some more than others.
Maybe, or they will use old footage. <eos> Like they did in Rogue One? <eos> Yes, showing a young Fisher.
I actually like Obi Wan Kenobi a lot. <eos> The old version or the young one? <eos> I like them both but I prefer the older Obi Wan.
I didn't, not as much as some do. <eos> Why not? <eos> He was irritating and took up a lot of time.
He was irritating on purpose, though, in order to train Luke. <eos> Why couldn't he have just introduced himself? <eos> He didn't introduce himself so he could judge Luke's reaction.
Hello. <eos> Do you have a favorite Star Wars film? <eos> I really enjoyed the Clone Wars.
Really? Im a big fan as well. <eos> What do you like most about them? <eos> I like the imagination aand the visual effects.
I guess they are ok. <eos> What's wrong with them? <eos> There's nothing wrong with them, I just miss the old characters.
That's true. <eos> Who's your favorite character? <eos> That's a hard question.
Jar Jar Binks. <eos> Haha, you picked the most annoying character as your favorite? <eos> Yea, that's exactly why I like him.
I watched it recently and was pleasantly surprised. <eos> Really? You liked it? <eos> Yes, it was really good.
Yeah me neither. This one was way better. <eos> Maybe I'll watch it then. They're doing three again right? <eos> Yep, the next one comes out in December.
I suppose. the whole thing felt like a fever dream. <eos> So the new movie is called The Last Jedi? <eos> Yes. And the next one comes out in 2019.
Yes it was. I think that tons of people saw it. <eos> Was there a big craze when it came out? <eos> Yes. People went crazy over it.
Yes. People went crazy over it. <eos> Are there any other films? <eos> Yes. There are tons of Star Wars films.
No, Leia's daughter with Han Solo. <eos> Wouldn't that make her a Solo? <eos> Well, half Skywalker anyway.
I like the third episode the best. <eos> The third episode of the originals or the prequels? <eos> The prequels, Revenge of the Sith.
The prequels, Revenge of the Sith. <eos> What makes that movie so special to you? <eos> I really enjoy watching Anakin Skywalker transform into Darth Vader.
Oh right, like a bandolier for laser blast packs. <eos> Yeah. How tall do you think he is? <eos> Over 7 feet for sure.
Hello. <eos> Are you familiar with star wars? <eos> Yeah I've seen a few of the newer movies.
Yeah I've seen a few of the newer movies. <eos> Have seen any of the original? <eos> No, I have seen the ones with ewan mcregor in them.
Yeah I guess. <eos> Did you like those? <eos> They were just okay.
Me too. <eos> Where are the other Yodas? <eos> Maybe he outlived them all....
I just watched the Force Awakens again. <eos> Did you find anything new in it? <eos> I was looking for clues to Ray's heritage.
I was looking for clues to Ray's heritage. <eos> Did you get any new ideas? <eos> I think she is a Skywalker.
I don't think Chewy would have given it up. <eos> Even to his Captain? <eos> Maybe.
Yes I would say so. <eos> Do you have a favorite one? <eos> I really enjoyed Empire Strikes Back.
I really enjoyed Empire Strikes Back. <eos> Why that one in particular? <eos> It is a little heavier than the first one.
Rogue One is my favorite Star Wars film. <eos> Whoa really, even over the original trilogy? <eos> Yeah it manages to capture two themes really well.
Yeah it manages to capture two themes really well. <eos> What themes are those? <eos> Bleakness and hopefulness, the movie is full of them both.
I was not a fan of the last one. <eos> The Force Awakens? <eos> No, Rogue One.
No, Rogue One. <eos> Why? <eos> I did not like the story.
Hello. <eos> Are you a fan of the Star Wars series? <eos> Yeah absolutely.
Yeah absolutely. <eos> Do you have a favorite? <eos> I am really looking forward to the new Lando movie.
Yeah it's supposed to be great. <eos> Who plays Lando? <eos> Donald Glover.
Hello. <eos> Do you know much about Star Wars? <eos> I know a little.
I know a little. <eos> Did you see most of the movies? <eos> I think I might have seen them all.
I think I might have seen them all. <eos> Oh cool.  Do you have one that you really like? <eos> I really liked The first one from the first series.
I really liked The first one from the first series. <eos> A new hope? <eos> Yeah that's it.
You were emo, that's right. <eos> What did you think of it? <eos> I only saw two-thirds of it.
Sony owned Spider-Man and Marvel the rest. <eos> Oh. They finally got it worked out, huh? <eos> Yeah, they made a deal.
Yeah, they made a deal. <eos> What kind of deal? <eos> Well, Sony still owns Spidey, but now they are collaborating.
I have seen all three. <eos> What did you think of them? <eos> The third one really bothered me.
Same here. The whole Peter Parker dance scene was really stupid. <eos> I argee.  Topher Grace as Eddy Brock? <eos> I know.  Eddy Brock is suppose to be pretty built.
Good.  Logan is trying to help his clone daughter escape. <eos> From who? <eos> The government.  They want to make her into a weapon.
The government.  They want to make her into a weapon. <eos> Does she have powers? <eos> Yes, she heals fast and has claws.
I just saw Sucker Punch the other day. <eos> The action movie? Did you like it? <eos> I liked the actions scenes more than the story.
I liked the actions scenes more than the story. <eos> Who was in that one? Jenna Malone? <eos> Yeah, Jenna Malone and Vanessa Hudgens were in it.
Not yet, but I've heard the music. <eos> How is the music? <eos> It's pretty horrible.
Gotta go with Batman. <eos> Which one? <eos> The original.
Agreed there.  Weird casting for sure. <eos> Are they planning any more Hulk movies? <eos> I think he's in the next Avengers if I remember correctly.
Know what's an under-rated superhero movie? The Crow. <eos> With Brandon Lee, who died? <eos> Yes, that one.
I think the same setting as always. <eos> Do you think it will travel to Thor's planets? <eos> No his character isnt that important.
It's funny how the same actors play different superheros. <eos> How do you mean? <eos> The Human Torch becomes Captain America.
I've seen it once or twice. <eos> Did you like it? <eos> More than most other superhero type movies.
Hello. <eos> Do you have a favorite superhero? <eos> Hmm let me think.
Classic yeah good choice. <eos> What about you? <eos> I really like the green lantern.
Yeah it was not all that great. <eos> Will he be in the Infinity War movie? <eos> I cant see them doing that, the movie wasnt like that.
I cant see them doing that, the movie wasnt like that. <eos> So they struck out on this one? <eos> Yeah because the movie was so strange.
I do, but more the classics. <eos> What super hero movie is your favorite then? <eos> I would have to say that my favorite is Captain America.
I agree, but I doubt we'll ever see a movie. <eos> Why not? <eos> No super powers.
Count me in. <eos> Do you know much about the movie? <eos> No, i've heard some things though.
I think his character stinks. <eos> Because he isnt from this planet? <eos> Yeah I think people dont like embracing that notion.
That's a tough call.... <eos> Why? <eos> They both played such different renditions.
They both played such different renditions. <eos> What if you had to choose? <eos> Have to go with Ledger. He played a psycho so well.
I laughed so hard at Deadpool. <eos> Was it good? <eos> Yes, Ryan Reynolds was amazing.
Exactly. Both know how to land a joke. <eos> How's the action? <eos> Great. Really fast paced.
Hey. <eos> Seen any superhero movies lately? <eos> Yeah.
Yeah. <eos> What did you see? <eos> I saw guardians of the galaxy 2.
I saw guardians of the galaxy 2. <eos> Where did you see that? <eos> Theaters.
No.  Is that the movie with Brandon Lee. <eos> Yes, you didn't see it though? <eos> No, but everyone knows about it.
Yeah, it kind of became famous for the wrong reasons. <eos> Do you believe the Lee family was cursed? <eos> Not really.  It was just bad luck.
Hey. <eos> Are you into all the superhero movies? <eos> Yeah they're great popcorn movies.
I agree. <eos> Do you have a favorite one? <eos> I liked the original spiderman.
I liked the original spiderman. <eos> With Toby Maguire? <eos> Yeah that's right.
Justice League right now. <eos> You say right now, what about of all time? <eos> I would said Guardians.
Guardians is a great movie, I watched it two times. <eos> What about you? <eos> I really liked Logan.
No, it was not very good. <eos> What didn't you like about it? <eos> Some of the casting choices were a little strange.
Some of the casting choices were a little strange. <eos> Are you talking about Lex Luthor? <eos> Yeah, Jesse Eisenburg was a strange choice.
Yeah, Jesse Eisenburg was a strange choice. <eos> Did you think he over acted? <eos> His performance was just strange.
I saw Wonder Woman the other day. <eos> How was it? <eos> It was good.  A bit slow in the beginning.
It was good.  A bit slow in the beginning. <eos> Did you like Gal Gadot? <eos> Yes, she was very pretty and likeable.
She looked great and was a good actress. <eos> Does she get involved with Chris Pines character? <eos> Yes, they fall in love.
It was cool watching all the super heroes fight Loki. <eos> Is he Thor's brother? <eos> Yes, but he is a bad guy.
Yeah written and directed by Mathew Vaughn. <eos> Who's Matthew Vaughn? <eos> He's done a few superhero movies like X-Men First Class.
Jack Nicholson. <eos> Really? Not Heath Ledger? <eos> Heath's performance was decent, but not that memorable to me.
Hey. <eos> Do you have a favorite super hero? <eos> I really like the green lantern.
Yeah I know, but I love that character. <eos> Like in the comics? <eos> Yeah.
Me too.  But the new one looks good. <eos> Oh, you mean Iron Man 4? <eos> Ha ha.  Hey, I like Robert Downey, Jr.
He'll be a tough act to follow. <eos> What about an Iron Woman? <eos> That'd be interesting.
Probably the first one. <eos> That was probably the best, but what about Civil War? <eos> That was more of a Captain America movie.
Hi. <eos> What is the best superhero movie you've ever seen? <eos> Tough question.
That one was very well done. <eos> What about you? <eos> I would have to agree with your choice.
Yeah, Spider-Man just stopping a mugger seems mundane after that. <eos> So, where do they go after Infinity War? <eos> Maybe introduce a new super villain, like Kang.
Yes, and I saw all Superman movies. <eos> Which did you like better? <eos> Wonder Woman by far.
Probably not. <eos> Why? <eos> They're coming out with Justice League.
I love the original Spiderman. <eos> Do you like the new one? <eos> No, I prefer the one from 2002.
Spiderman 2 was awful. <eos> With Toby Maguire? <eos> Yeah.
Well Marvel has a specific contract with them. <eos> So who moves on first? <eos> I think Robert will because hes getting older.
He did a really good job in 'The Dark Knight' movies. <eos> Who's your favorite? <eos> I think it's Michael Keaton.
I think it's Michael Keaton. <eos> Why is he your favorite? <eos> He played the character just right to me.
You should. It will open your mind to many new concepts. <eos> What is the best part of the movie? <eos> The graphics. There are some scenes that are beautiful.
That's what it looks like. <eos> Have you seen the trailers? <eos> No, just a few posters and images on the web.
No, just a few posters and images on the web. <eos> Did Thor cut his hair? <eos> I think so.
I REALLY hope he obliterates the Avengers. <eos> How badly? <eos> Well, they need to kill someone off.
I'll probably wait for the DVD. <eos> Why? <eos> I wasn't real thrilled with the actress.
I can't believe yet another Thor movie is coming out. <eos> What's this one called? <eos> Ragnarok.  Seems like a departure from the previous two.
Ragnarok.  Seems like a departure from the previous two. <eos> Isn't he enslaved or something? <eos> Something like that.  The trailer looked interesting.
I like the Hulk. <eos> You mean in the Avengers? <eos> Yes. He was so strong.
I mean they have Batman but havent developed anyone else. <eos> Like who? <eos> Anyone, Ironman integrated other characters.
Anyone, Ironman integrated other characters. <eos> So whos fault is it? <eos> I guess you could say the producers.
I think it was great. <eos> Did you think he was a show on feminism? <eos> Not at all, it was about a heroine thats all.
Hey there. <eos> Fan of superhero movies? <eos> Yeah I like them.
Yeah I like them. <eos> What was the last one you saw? <eos> I saw the hulk a while ago.
I saw the hulk a while ago. <eos> Which one? <eos> The ed norton one.
Yeah, I heard Wonder Woman was good. <eos> That's the one with Gal Gadot, right? <eos> I think so. Chris Pine is in it too.
Yeah, it's a bit redundant. <eos> Where would you like them to attack? <eos> Maybe Miami, Orlando, Atlanta, Portland, Buffalo...
As much as I hate those awful cities, it wouldn't work. <eos> Why not? <eos> Outside of Disney World, there are no big landmarks there.
They are handling it well. <eos> How so? <eos> The movies are intertwining with one another.
Yeah, it's a good one. Not my favorite though. <eos> So, don't leave me hanging? <eos> I like Avengers Civil War or may the first X-Men movie.
Hi there. <eos> Would you consider yourself a fan of the superhero genre? <eos> Yeah I would say so.
Yeah I would say so. <eos> Do you have a favorite? <eos> I would say probably batman.
I would say probably batman. <eos> Which one? <eos> The christopher nolan ones.
Hey. <eos> You into superhero movies? <eos> I mean I've watched a few.
I mean I've watched a few. <eos> Do you have a favorite one? <eos> I liked the avengers.
I liked the avengers. <eos> The first one? <eos> Yeah the first one.
Absolutely! We should go together. <eos> Agreed. What is most appealing about it? <eos> Probably the new Spider Man.
The second time anyway. <eos> Second time? <eos> Yeah. He was Wade Wilson in X-Men origins.
the spiderman franchise sucks in my opinion. <eos> what? why? <eos> the plot is no good, thats why.
Hi. <eos> What was the most recent superhero movie that you saw? <eos> I watched guardians of the galaxy 2 recently.
I watched guardians of the galaxy 2 recently. <eos> Did you see that in the theaters? <eos> Yeah.
Yeah. <eos> What did you think? <eos> I thought it was pretty good.
I thought it was pretty good. <eos> Better than the first? <eos> I wouldn't say that.
I am a huge Marvel fan. <eos> Whats your favorite movie out of the series? <eos> I like the Iron Man Movies.
I like both but I prefer Marvel. <eos> Same here. What's your favorite Marvel movie? <eos> I would have to say Captain America: Civil War.
Also the characters personalities were pretty on point with the comics. <eos> Who was your favorite of the four heroes? <eos> Probably The Thing.
I thought it was pretty good. <eos> What is your favorite super hero movie from Marvel? <eos> I liked The Avengers.

Yes, he did a good job. <eos> Who was your favorite character? <eos> Captain America of course.
Yeah I think it is actually. <eos> Did you watch it? <eos> Yeah I've seen hell boy.  really like it.
Not yet, but I want to. <eos> Have you seen The Lego movie? <eos> Yeah, and it was really good.
No, I didn't know that. <eos> Did you like Batman in the Lego movie? <eos> Yeah, he was hilarious.
Yeah, he was hilarious. <eos> Do you want to go watch Lego Batman today? <eos> Yeah let's go.
Well, that's probably why. <eos> What do you mean? <eos> I mean, he's more relatable.  Superman is an alien.
The blue one who does martial arts and can transform. <eos> Oh, right. Jennifer Lawrence and Rebecca Romaine-Stamos? <eos> Yup, that's them. I like the latter.
Yup, that's them. I like the latter. <eos> Why? <eos> She's far more vicious and believable as a villain.
he was pure anarchy and crazinesss. <eos> DO YOU KNOW HOW I GOT THESE SCARS??? <eos> yeah, and he kept changing his reasoning.
Probably, Deadpool. <eos> Oh really? Why do you like it? <eos> The action and humor were great.
Count me in. <eos> Awesome, is Wolverine in it? <eos> You serious?  Of course he is.
They need to make a Tick movie. <eos> A what movie? <eos> The Tick.
It wasn't too bad, but it didn't last long. <eos> Who played the Tick? <eos> Patrick Warburton.
It definitely earned its R rating.  It's not kid appropriate. <eos> How did Ryan Reynolds do in it? <eos> He was brilliant.  So funny and charming.
Ya I did. I saw two of them in the theater. <eos> Which one was your favorite? <eos> I think I liked the third one the best.
I agree totally. <eos> Want to watch it again tomorrow? <eos> Sure thing.
I think Dredd was great. <eos> Why did you like it? <eos> Well it's sci-fi which is one of my favorite genres.
Yeah, his insides should be mush after that. <eos> Yours? <eos> Everything about the pit in The Dark Knight Rises.
Agreed! So glad we got to know his character better. <eos> Are you looking forward to any of the upcoming films? <eos> I'm excited for the next movie featuring all of the Avengers.
That would be my choice as well. <eos> What did you think of Heath Ledgers performance? <eos> I thought it was absolutely fabulous and right on the money.
Hey. <eos> Do you have a favorite super hero movie? <eos> I like the captain america one.
I like the captain america one. <eos> The first one? <eos> The one with his friend.
Yeah, there have been a couple TV shows. <eos> Are you following the latest one? <eos> I've seen a few episodes.
They keep rebuffing the cast, so probably not. <eos> Cant you see them branching into the Marvel Cinematic Universe? <eos> No I think a different studio owns the rights.
Yes, but not in theaters. I loved it though. <eos> How come you do not like newer superhero movies? <eos> Too many effects and not enough craft.
Yes I love James Bond. <eos> Me too. Which one is your favorite? <eos> Dr. No.
Dr. No. <eos> So Sean Connery is your favorite Bond? <eos> Yes for sure.
Interesting. <eos> Which is yours? <eos> Daniel Craig.
One of my favorites. <eos> Didn't that win an award? <eos> The Oscar for best picture.
That is too bad. <eos> Really? <eos> Yeah because I recently saw the Dark Knight.
Hitchcock does that in all of his films. <eos> What is your favorite part of The Birds? <eos> I like every scene equally. They are all great.
Shudder Island, just saw it. <eos> With Leonardo Dicaprio? <eos> Yes, it is sort of set in the 1930's.
Yes, it is sort of set in the 1930's. <eos> He is in like a mental institution right? <eos> Yep, he spends most his time thinking he is a detective.
Yep, he spends most his time thinking he is a detective. <eos> But there is a twist? <eos> Yep, he is actually a patient.
Yeah, it's scary to think of it happening to me. <eos> Do you get to see the baby? <eos> Not really; they more describe it than show it.
The Godfather, by a long shot. <eos> Which one? <eos> All three.
All three. <eos> Can't decide, huh? <eos> They're all too connected.
Yeah, it was Captain Phillips. <eos> Did you see it? <eos> Yeah, it was pretty good.
A little bit. <eos> Which movie is your favorite? <eos> In Her Name.
In Her Name. <eos> Who is in that? <eos> Sebastian Koch.
Sebastian Koch. <eos> Oh interesting. When did it come out? <eos> 2016.
Makes you think when you go on vacation. <eos> Yes, but who would just pull into a shady looking motel? <eos> I guess now, nobody would.
It does, but I love it. I love the whole genre. <eos> I haven't watched The Strangers yet. Should I? <eos> It's one of the most terrifying movies, in my opinion.
Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Jack Nicholson... <eos> Oh, you mean The Departed? <eos> Yep.  That's the one I'm thinking of.
Yep, he got the last laugh on Damon at the end. <eos> Did you know it was a remake of a Japanese film? <eos> Really?  Didn't know that.
Prisoners, with Hugh Jackman. <eos> Is it good? <eos> I think it is one of his best performances.
I like them a bit. <eos> What have you seen recently? <eos> The movie Lucy.
The movie Lucy. <eos> With Scarlett Johansson? <eos> Yes.
Yes. <eos> How was it? <eos> It was alright.
It was alright. <eos> Would I like it? <eos> Perhaps.
Yeah, it was great. <eos> Was it action-packed? <eos> Definitely. And Hugh Jackman did an excellent job.
Yes I do. <eos> Which ones? <eos> I like the Matrix.
Oh that is cool. I don't like the first one. <eos> The first one is the best. Which do you like? <eos> I like Reloaded.
I have gotten really into like period piece thrillers. <eos> Set in olden times? <eos> Yes. Like the Prestige.
Yes. Like the Prestige. <eos> With Christian Bale? <eos> Yes, and the magic and mystery.
It's about a serial killer.  He's played by Anthony Hopkins. <eos> Oh, he's good.  Is he scary in this? <eos> Yes, he is very scary.  You won't forget the performance.
Yes, he is very scary.  You won't forget the performance. <eos> Didn't he win an Oscar for that? <eos> He did win an Oscar for the performance.  It's deserved.
I saw Cape Fear last night. <eos> The old one or the remake? <eos> Original.
Original. <eos> Cool.  Who was the bad guy? <eos> Robert Mitchum.

I saw 'What Lies Beneath' and the suspense was great. <eos> That's an older one, right? <eos> Yes, it came out about 15 years ago.
Yes I watched it when I was young. <eos> Did you like it? <eos> I think so, I dont really remember it.
It is really a movie for adults. <eos> OK and is it good? <eos> Yes it is very thrilling.
Along Came A Spider. <eos> I might have seen that. Is it older? <eos> Yes, it's from 2001.
Yes, it's from 2001. <eos> Who was in it? <eos> Morgan Freeman.

It came out this year. <eos> Is Jordan Peele in it? <eos> No, he just directed it.
There is one I really liked, called 127 hours. <eos> What is it about? <eos> It is based on a true story.
Yeah, it was early in her career. <eos> Who else was in that movie? <eos> I think it was Jodie Foster.
Yes for sure. <eos> What about The Fugitive? <eos> Yes that was a good one also.
Yes that was a good one also. <eos> Can you imagine getting blamed for something you didn't do? <eos> I know I think I would run too.
Yeah, it lasted a few seasons, but it just ended. <eos> Oh, what was the name of it? <eos> It was called Bates Motel.
It was called Bates Motel. <eos> It follows the same story line? <eos> Actually, it shows why Normal turned into a crazy person.
Not as much as some movies, but a little bit. <eos> What did you think of it? <eos> I loved it! Joel Edgerton was amazing.
They are alright. <eos> What have you seen recently? <eos> I saw the movie The Visit.
It kind of was. <eos> Who was in that again? <eos> Olivia De Jonge.
Not particularly, but there is one from 1976 that is stellar. <eos> What is the name? <eos> It is called Taxi Driver.
It is a really great movie. <eos> Why is that? <eos> There is a lot going on in it.
There is a lot going on in it. <eos> Ok and is it a thriller also? <eos> Yes it is very thrilling.
I am a big fan of that director as well. <eos> That one came out in what month? <eos> January I believe is when it came out.
